Use the new_web_crawler.py!!!
this project aims to collect information from a specific web site and do data crawling 
the pipeline configuratio i have in mind right now is as follows:

  kick start the code: get initial links to different jobs
  
  go to the web page of the jobs and retrieve information I need; Also, try to get links to the similar jobs recommened by the system 
  
  iterate until the counter hits my limit 
 
  Another configuration:
  
  Kick start the code: get the first page 
  
  go to the second page, third page... 
  
  collect information 
  
However, neither of the pipeline works
