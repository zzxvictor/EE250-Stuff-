It is our mission to empower every person to improve their life through DNA. With our high-quality, trusted partners and state-of-the-art lab, we have created the first platform of personalized products and services powered by genetics. From inherited cancer screening to custom fitness and nutrition plans, the world of DNA learning is becoming more accessible and more valuable than ever.  So far we have raised over $300 million from investors like Illumina (the worlds leader in genetic sequencing equipment), Warburg Pincus, Sutter Hill Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Draper Fisher Jurvetson Growth. Our app store and marketplace include partners such as National Geographic, Admera Health, Vinome and many others, with whom we have partnered to develop applications which interpret your genome.  Our big vision comes with big responsibility. Thats why were building a team of experts in the field of genetics, engineering, design, business development, and beyond to help bring actionable insights to our customers. Were looking for the best and brightest minds who are passionate about our mission and are excited to work with a truly diverse team.  We are looking for scientists to join our growing Research team. This role is ideal for an scientist trained in population genetics, biostatistics, or genetic epidemiology. The successful candidate will perform population-scale analysis using public and internal genotype, exome, and phenotype data to evaluate, explore, and identify genetic associations and underpinnings of phenotypic traits and disease. You will have the opportunity to work in a highly collaborative environment with our team of scientists, bioinformaticians, and engineers, where your impact will be new genetic insights that are published in peer-reviewed journals and translated into new products for our users. Above all, you have an insatiable curiosity, entrepreneurial spirit, enjoy team science, and are excited about the potential discoveries we will make by leveraging the largest CLIA-certified exome dataset in the world.
