Data Warehouse and Application (DWA) is a group within this department that provides information for integrated reporting/analysis and supports the AllScripts EPSi system.  Omniview is an integrated data warehouse supplied by sources external and internal to UCSF Health. Its data and associated business rules are integrated into a hybrid Inmon/Kimball architecture housed in MS SQL Server using SQL Server Integrated Services (SSIS) as the ETL tool and SQL Agent as scheduler. Current internal sources include APeX (via CLARITY \u2013 Hospital Billing, Professional Billing, ADT, Inpatient, etc.), costing/budget from EPSi, IR Solution\u2019s Incident Reporting System, PeopleSoft GL, HBS Time & Attendance, UCSF Payroll, patient care data from Nursing Performance Improvement surveys via Salesforce and McKesson\u2019s PFM.

Primary activities include the design, implementation, testing, documentation and support of data models within Omniview (and its associated data marts) along with the ETL processes that produce useful business intelligence capabilities for UCSF Health.  The data warehouse staff performs various functions that require multiple skill sets - SQL, data modelling/profiling, DBA skills, SSIS package programming, MS Team Foundation and effective communication with SMEs (Subject Matter Experts).

A working knowledge of the source\u2019s backend data structure and the ability to access the data from the frontend presentation layer, as well as its backend, is paramount. This knowledge allows the staff to modify the architecture of Omniview so that the data can be integrated and an automated ETL process can be created.  This involves data profiling, determining any commonalities with Omniview, incorporating the data into Omniview, updating its data model and metadata, ensuring referential integrity via foreign key constraints throughout the data model and building an automated ETL process. Coordination with the support groups of the source systems is crucial to ensure that access can be achieved and guaranteed on an ongoing basis.
