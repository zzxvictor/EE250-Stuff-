As a Data Engineer in the Office of the CTO, your role requires some hands-on applied data science/data engineering with real-world data, some software development of extensions of Lucidworks product line, and some end-to-end demos and proof-of-concepts to show off new ideas for data-driven end products.  This role in particular will involve exploring new technologies which Lucidworks may not fully utilize yet: a connector to a new database or NoSQL engine or distributed filesystem, or an RPC connection to an external Voice-to-Text or Image Search system, or validating the idea that running Lucidworks product suite on top of an alternative cloud platform will work as desired.  The product lifecycle you\u2019ll participate in is probably a little different than traditional tech companies: you will occasionally work directly with customers, building individualized extensions to our systems as essentially part of a technical product marketing effort, then working to generalize these solutions to work in a broader environment; then, for some of these projects, you will work directly with the Product Engineering organization to productionalize your work, helping shepherd it into the final product release.  You have at least 2-4 years of software industry experience working with Service Oriented Architecture handling data driven products such as Search, Recommender Systems, and/or Machine Learning as a Service.

U.S.-based candidates only for this role, but we are a geographically distributed team, with team-members working from home (and occasionally co-working spaces) in the Seattle, Raleigh-Durham, and metro-D.C. areas currently, so you should be West Coast (Seattle or SF preferred), Raleigh/Durham, or Washington DC based.
