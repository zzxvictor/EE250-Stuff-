With data from in-car sensors, a mobile internet connected car, increased computing power, and new user interfaces that support a seamless autonomous driving experience, they will dramatically improve our lives. After home and work, the car is where we spend the most time, and we will be working on making that experience pleasurable.NIO is much more than a car company. We are developing highly performance-optimized electric cars that will help reduce pollution and mitigate global warming, along with autonomous driving capability that will give time back to the drivers. AI will play a critical role in achieving this by using data combined with machine learning and AI algorithms for problems spanning autonomous driving, intelligent navigation, predictive diagnostics, and vehicle health. We are looking for exceptional ML talent to join our team to work on these core problem areas.Responsibilities\u00b7 Researching, prototyping, and building solutions for autonomous vehicle  decision making primarily focused on\u00b7 using reinforcement-learning/online-optimization algorithms for training a vehicle's decision making by leveraging simulations, rewarding good behavior and punishing bad behavior.\u00b7 predicting the intended trajectory and paths of moving objects surrounding the ego-vehicle via machine learning approaches.\u00b7 Researching, prototyping, and building solutions for autonomous vehicle simulation development using approaches from reinforcement learning / game theory algorithms for generating agent behaviors for all the vehicles in the simulator\u00b7 Researching, prototyping, and building solutions for optimizing the performance of the powertrain system by using smart predictive pre-conditioning algorithms\u00b7 Implementing the algorithms and testing them in a python/C++ environmentRequirements\u00b7 PhD in Computer Science in Computer Science, Robotics, EE or related degree\u00b7 5+ Years of experience in machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, robotics and optimization algorithms\u00b7 Exposure to vehicle and powertrain modeling and dynamics, motion prediction, and kinematics\u00b7 Programming skills in Python or C++\u00b7 Communication and presentation skills to convey information and results clearly and concisely.\u00b7 High-energy self-starter with a passion for your work, attention to detail, and a positive attitude.About NIO Our mission is to shape a joyful lifestyle for our users by offering smart, premium electric vehicles and providing the best user experience.
