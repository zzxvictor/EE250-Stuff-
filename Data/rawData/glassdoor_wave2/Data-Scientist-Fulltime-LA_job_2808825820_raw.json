ISI operates one of the world\u2019s largest academic high-performance computing clusters. ISI has three research campuses: one in Marina Del Rey, CA; one in Arlington, VA; and one in Waltham, MA. *This position is located in Arlington, VA.* The Reconfigurable Computing Group at the University of Southern California\u2019s Information Sciences Institute is a long-time pioneer of research investigating Field Programmable Gate Arrays. Spanning the days of homogeneous logic devices to today\u2019s billion transistor System on Chip devices, RCG has led the way from being the first to implement application level partial runtime reconfiguration, investigating 3D FPGA architectures, developing Autonomous System on Chip architectures, releasing open source CAD tools which target real physical devices, IP to address software / hardware co-design complexity and continues today with research ranging from developing programming models for next generation industry devices to conducting experiments on the International Space Station. Today, RCG is addressing our nation\u2019s challenges in big data, hardware cybersecurity, trusted systems, cognitive radio and more.  USC/ISI is looking for highly talented, motivated researchers to lead and impact state of the art research and development in the area of reconfigurable computing. This position will lead research in algorithm development for custom internal tools which target FPGA and ASIC front end design. These tools solve challenging problems in hardware security, high level abstraction for hardware design, and machine learning acceleration for critical systems. Develop and realize effectiveness of solutions on physical FPGAs and custom ASIC fabrication. Lead research, propose major innovations, collaborate with peers within the group and across ISI, publish results in top tier conferences, and contribute to or lead proposals. Required Job QualificationsQualified candidates for this position must be willing and eligible to obtain and maintain a collateral Secret clearance. Eligibility for this clearance requires U.S. citizenship.
