Building high powered intelligence atop our large-scale datasets is a serious challenge and we\u2019re looking for candidates who are ready to dig in. Postmates isn\u2019t just another ad platform or mobile app for delivering static content: We have real customers paying real money for a real service. What does this team do? Postmates enables hundreds of millions of dollars in local commerce every year. Our uniquely flexible platform facilitates the delivery of virtually anything from anywhere in over 60+ U.S. cities and we\u2019re set to expand both our transaction volume as well as geographic footprint even further. Safeguarding this success takes work and that\u2019s where the Postmates Risk Team comes in.  The Risk Team at Postmates builds systems to assess risk in real time and protect the platform from fraud. Our infrastructure aggregates, stores, and retrieves mission critical data. It supports statistical model creation and deployment. And it houses a real time graph database that provides a highly detailed picture of the entire Postmates ecosystem. Through the tools we build, the features we deploy, and the policies we put in place, we ensure the platform can continue to scale without succumbing to the threat of bad actors. What will you do? As a Senior Risk Data Scientist, you\u2019ll help pioneer the future of on-demand fraud prevention and actively contribute to creating Postmates\u2019 risk mitigation strategy. You\u2019ll use your full toolkit -- statistical modeling, machine learning, data mining, and software engineering -- to understand the unique characteristics of bad actors and how they differ from the general population of legitimate customers. You\u2019ll help safeguard the platform from financial fraud, evaluating risk as it happens and working with operations to head it off at the pass. You\u2019ll use your expertise to help us make the tradeoffs necessary to move the business forward. And you\u2019ll share your experience as you mentor other members of the team.

Explaining complex technical concepts to product managers, support, and other engineers shouldn\u2019t be a problem for you.You are scrappy. You understand the challenges, nuances, and details of working with messy data and if the data doesn\u2019t exist, you go build it.You love it when things work, you understand that things break, and when things do fail, you dive in to determine the root causes and fix whatever\u2019s broken.BONUS POINTSPrevious production grade software engineering experienceExperience with distributed / large scale machine learningExperience in small start-up environmentBENEFITSCompetitive salary and generous stock option planMedical, dental and vision insuranceWe'll provide equipment you need to work efficiently and creativelyPaid parental leave, vacation time and sick timeCatered lunches and open snack barImpact-first work environment (no politics, no pandering)Huge company vision (we need you to build the future, not just maintain the status quo)Full support to contribute to open source projectsAwesome office located in Financial District just minutes from BART, Muni, AC Transit, and SamTrans"}
