We collect and analyze massive amounts of data to help our partners better predict risk and understand how people move. The Arity Platform is built on billions of miles of historical driving data with more than one million active telematics connections and 10+ years of data directly from cars.Job Description  Title: Telematics Data Scientist X3 (MULTIPLE OPENINGS)  Duties: Build predictive models and develop new machine learning techniques. Develop statistical modeling and/or machine learning techniques on telematics data that would handle a wide range of problems ranging from (but not limited to) probabilistic inference on phone trajectories, data fusion between noisy sensors, and classification of driving behavior. Work on data analysis and predictive modeling of sensor data collected from vehicles and mobile phones (E.g. GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.). Identify KPI\u2019s generated from telematics sensor data. Manage data and data requests to improve the accuracy of our data and decisions made from data analysis. Collaborate with the team to improve the effectiveness of business decisions through the use of data and machine learning/predictive modeling. Communicate findings to team and leadership to ensure models are well understood and incorporated into business processes, and work with leadership to understand priorities and product needs and translates those into data and modeling products. Work on end to end life cycle from problem definition, data acquisition, exploratory data analysis, model building, deploying, supporting, monitoring to revising models in a production setting. Lead and participate in peer reviews, code reviews and other department activities.  Job Qualifications  Education & Experience Requirements:  PhD (or foreign educational equivalent) in Statistics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics, or related field and one (1) year of experience using statistical modeling and/or machine learning techniques to process or build models on telematics or sensor data to drive a company\u2019s business results.  or, alternatively, a Master\u2019s degree in one of the enumerated fields and four (4) years of experience as stated above.  or, alternatively, a Bachelor\u2019s degree in one of the enumerated fields and six (6) years of experience as stated above.
