While this role will work relatively independently on the project itself there will be significant input and help from the Director of Finance and the IT department. Technical exposure should include Power BI experience and the ability to extract data from a SQL database or Data Warehouse. Currently there are roughly 10 critical financial reports coming via Business Objects that must be recreated prior to budgeting season in late Q3/Q4, beyond this there are several less critical and infrequently used reports that will need to be recreated as time passes. In addition, strong communication skills and technical documentation will be critical to the success of the role.
