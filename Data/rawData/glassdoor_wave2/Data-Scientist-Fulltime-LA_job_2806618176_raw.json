The City of Hope Diabetes and Metabolism Research Institute (DMRI) is home to a multidisciplinary team of endocrinologists, diabetes immunologists, stem cell biologists, geneticists and other clinical and basic science investigators, who together aim to advance treatment options for, and someday cure both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The DMRI has received a generous philanthropic gift with an ambitious goal to cure type 1 diabetes in less than six years. Several novel cellular and immunotherapies for type 1 diabetes are in development, with multiple clinical trials slated to open in Spring 2018.  Essential Functions  Develop In-depth Knowledge of DMRI Research Goals and Areas of Emphasis: Scientists are expected to become well-versed in the terminology, biology and treatments associated with the DMRI. Scientists will attend DMRI meetings and relevant seminars/conferences to gain a thorough familiarity with the ongoing research interests of the DMRI PIs as needed.  Clinical Project Design and Grant Writing: Scientists will assist and advise DMRI PIs in design and preparation of new clinical projects for funding as requested. They will edit/write portions of the text and frame the clinical project as appropriate for the specific grant application. Scientists may also assist with grant progress reports for clinical projects they are managing.  Clinical Protocol Writing and Submission: Scientists will work with the clinical study team (laboratory and clinical investigators, biostatisticians, research nurses, investigational pharmacists) on clinical trial design and protocol preparation for DMRI investigator-initiated clinical trials. Scientists may also develop other clinical protocol related documents (letters of intent, consent documents, patient materials, IRB application, investigator brochures etc.) For translational projects involving a City of Hope-held Investigational New Drug Application (IND), they will provide and review text and figures for IND submission.  Manuscript Writing: Scientists will advise and assist investigators with interpretation and presentation of data for publication related to their clinical projects. As requested, may edit/write portions of the manuscript text related to the clinical projects they are managing.  Data Presentations: Scientists will work with the study team to assure the clarity and accuracy of data presented, as well as the interpretation of results. They will contribute to the aesthetic aspects of data presentation, including formatting of text (to required specifications) and creation/refinement of clear, appealing data figures, graphics and treatment schemas. This extends to meeting abstracts, presentations, grants, protocols and manuscripts.  Minimum Education: Master\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u00ac\u00e2\u00a2s Degree with at least five years of scientific writing, clinical study design, or clinical trial regulatory experience in a healthcare/research/academic environment.  Preferred Education: Ph.D. in immunology, metabolism/diabetes, molecular biology, stem cell biology or other life science with at least 2 years of relevant experience.  Preferred Experience: Involvement with human observational or therapeutic studies, protocol design/writing for human sample, observational/retrospective or therapeutic studies, NIH or DOD research grant writing (R01 level, not post-doctoral fellowships). Familiarity with data analysis techniques, graphing methods, and interpretation of data.  Skills: Excellent scientific writing, organizational and interpersonal skills are key.  Aptitude: Ability to work independently and as part of a team, meet deadlines, perform and prioritize multiple simultaneous tasks. Requires judgment that could affect the image of City of Hope and the DMRI.  Software: Proficiency in use of Microsoft Word, EndNote, Excel and PowerPoint.
