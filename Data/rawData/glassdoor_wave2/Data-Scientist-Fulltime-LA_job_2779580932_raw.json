We thrive on finding and cultivating talented people who are passionate about what they do. Join us and be a part of the diverse Caltech community.Job SummaryThe Beckman Institute at the California Institute of Technology seeks a highly qualified and motivated Research Scientist for projects focused on the discovery of novel adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) for gene therapy applications in the Beckman Institute Resource Center for CLARITY, Optogenetics and Vector Engineering (CLOVER Center: clover.caltech.edu). These funded projects will use and adapt the CREATE methodology our group developed (Chan et al Nature Neuroscience 2017; Deverman et al. Nature Biotechnology 2016) for custom AAV capsid engineering. The work will be fast-paced, challenging and collaborative, and therefore requires that the candidate is well organized and has strong problem-solving, interpersonal and communication skills. It is essential that the applicant has hands-on experience with molecular cloning, cell culture, and animal models. The ideal candidate would also have experience with recombinant virus production, fluorescence microscopy, directed evolution, computational biology and analysis of large datasets. Candidates should have, or be working toward, a doctoral degree in a biological science and a strong record of productivity. The position requires outstanding organizational skills, as well as experience in the managing of a life science laboratory and collaborations. The candidate will work independently under general guidance from the supervisor and must exhibit strong problem solving skills (e.g. be able to accurately recognize irregularities in experimental results and modify experiments as needed). Must be accurate, efficient, organized and keep detailed records. Strong written and verbal communication skills and the ability to work in a multi-disciplinary environment are essential. Two positions are available immediately. Competitive pay and benefits, based on experience level.Job DutiesThe research involves the planning, discovery and evaluation of new AAV vectors and will require the researcher to perform  \u2013Literature search and independent project planning  \u2013Proprietary virus library design (by novel directed evolution methods)  \u2013Molecular cloning, DNA and titering  \u2013Cell culture for recombinant AAV and possibly lentivirus production and validation  \u2013Discovery of novel variants with unique properties - requires functional quantitative evaluation of vectors in vitro and in vivo  \u2013In vivo vector administration, tissue processing, DNA/RNA isolation, immunohistochemistry and microscopy  Manage a life science laboratory and collaborations  \u2013Train laboratory personnel and coordinate daily operations for smooth functioning  \u2013Run teaching workshops for outside collaborators  \u2013Work closely with the PI and other laboratory staff to adapt methodology to fit research requirements and ensure that research timelines are kept on track  \u2013Guide collaborators on best choices for their experimental paradigms  The researcher will also be expected to  \u2013Write manuscripts and create figures for publications  \u2013Prepare grant progress reports and figures and text for grant applications  \u2013Present findings at group meetings and participate in lab discussions  \u2013Keep careful recordsBasic Qualifications\u2013 BS degree in biology, biological engineering, or a related field  \u2013 Prior hands-on experience with molecular cloning, DNA/RNA isolation, mammalian tissue/cell culture, qPCR, transfections  \u2013 Working knowledge of sequence analysis tools such as BLAST, SnapGene/DNA Star/Vector NTI and primer design software  \u2013 Must have prior experience with mouse models  \u2013 Must be self-motivated and organized  \u2013 Must have excellent communication and interpersonal skills \u2013 the project requires a coordinated effort within and across laboratories  \u2013 Excellent communication skills (writing and verbal) and the ability to interact professionally with students and all levels of staff as well as with external collaborators  \u2013 Ability to handle a variety of tasks simultaneously  \u2013 Ability to resolve technical problems and adapt easily to changing needs and priorities  \u2013 Must possess a high level of initiative Preferred Qualifications\u2013 MS or PhD in biology, biological engineering, or a related field  \u2013 Experience working with recombinant viral vectors under BSL2 conditions  \u2013 Hands on experience with fluorescence and confocal microscopy  \u2013 Stereotaxic injections  \u2013 Experience with immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization  \u2013 Experience with computational biology and analysis of next generation sequencing datasets  \u2013 Familiarity with high throughput screens/selections, DNA library design, and directed evolution  \u2013 Excellent organization, time management and project management skillsRequired Documents\u2013 Resume"}
