Requisition 13743  Postdoctoral scientist, M\u00c3\u00c2\u00bcschen Laboratory  Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute Position Summary and Key Responsibilities: Our group is interested in comparative analyses of normal lymphocyte development and malignant transformation towards leukemia. We cover research areas with relevance to both Immunology, Hematology and Cancer Biology. Our research involves experiments with primary human leukemia cells, leukemia and stem cell transplantation models, mouse genetics, classical molecular and cell biology, a strong emphasis on signal transduction and large-scale data analysis and computational biology.  Your application should include in one singlePDF:  CV, brief motivation statement, coordinates of three scientific mentors (references) Methods/Techniques: Flow cytometry, mass spectrometry/quantitative phospho-profiling, CyTOF, mouse genetics, bone marrow transplantation assays, retroviral gene delivery, whole exome sequencing andRNA-seq-analysis of clonal evolution of leukemia, pre-clinical drug testing in xenotransplantation models.
