One of my calls was to a small recruiting firm in Foster City, which ended up recruiting me and my life has been recruiting focused since. While the mechanics of a job search are very basic, its the intricate details that can muddle things up. That's where my experience comes in. One thing I will never do is to send your resume to a client without finding out if you are interested in the opportunity. I am also a firm believer that if I treat my candidates and clients with respect and professionalism, they will be relationships for life. This is important, as the key to being a successful recruiter is the ability to have candidates feel comfortable about giving their friends as referrals.Recent Postshttp://www.verticalmove.com/2013/ Job Info Category Data Science/AI/Machine Learning Employment Type Full-Time Employment Compensation $0.00 - $0.00 Location United States, CA - 94303 Client Introduction Using complex algorithms to mine the vast untapped data sources every company has and then applying predictive analytics that allows our customers to increase their rate of return for sales enablement in the enterprise market.
