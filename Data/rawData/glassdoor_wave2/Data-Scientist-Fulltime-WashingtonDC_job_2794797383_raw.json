You\u2019d spend your time working with experts, building capabilities that improve their day-to-day lives and the lives of our customers. How would you enjoy competing with those same analysts: you make their lives easier\u2026 and they come up with increasingly clever challenges? In the end, everyone wins.  Plenty of data science jobs in the world provide tremendous opportunity to work with diverse data sets, explore data relationships, bridge between structured and unstructured data, and ultimately deliver absolutely nothing a customer ever sees.  This is not that job.  We can\u2019t afford to spin our wheels. The information security space has some fascinating challenges buried within and across mountains of data. To start with, we have basic artifacts like logs and malware. As advanced security products have proliferated we\u2019ve seen a tremendous uptick in large event streams: files written, processes launched, DNS lookups and responses, libraries loaded across every host in an enterprise\u2026 it just keeps going. The challenge most security companies face remains figuring out what\u2019s good and what\u2019s bad. The challenge from there is in effectively communicating how good or bad something is without using floats. After all, we believe if the value of what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t obvious to customers, we\u2019ve failed.  Imagine a world in which all the security decisions being made by a SOC were labels available to you: confirmed bad data, good data, false positives and negatives, and even completed incident/investigation reports. Now imagine if you had API layer that abstracted away the intricacies of individual security vendors. Yeah, we think that\u2019s a pretty cool place to start too. If your mind is reeling with ideas, we\u2019d love to hear from you. Interested?

What You Should Bring With You A sense of humor about how over-used ML and AI are\u2026 look, there are things it can and can\u2019t doAbility to collaborate and work with teams throughout the organization4+ years with machine learning algorithms. You hate when gradients vanish or explode, you have a love hate relationship with dimensionality. As an expert, you can discern when it is appropriate to create an algorithm, and when multinomial logistic regression is probably good enough, but also when you need to reach deeper into one-shot learning using siamese networks. Above all else you want to see machine learning make a company impact.A fundamental curiosity around how great engineering teams function, how SOC operations work, and what provides great security value to customersLove and respect for python and all it can do for youAn appreciation for some deep learning and visualization frameworks that have cropped up over the years. Obviously, everyone loves sklearn learn and matplotlib, but there\u2019s your favorite amongst the newer frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, etc Additional InformationThis role is based out of our offices in Herndon,Virginia.
