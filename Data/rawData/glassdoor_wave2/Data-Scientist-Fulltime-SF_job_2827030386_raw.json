The Scientist will join a team of researchers utilizing the world\u2019s most advanced high-throughput, automated strain engineering and testing platform. The successful candidate will formulate hypotheses, design experiments, interpret data, and design, build, and test microbial strains and enzymes to improve strain performance in industrial fermentation conditions. ResponsibilitiesWork with a team to develop a new manufacturing strain & process for innovative, sustainable bio-manufacturingDesign strains, experiments, and screens to understand and remove barriers to high strain performanceWork with researchers from the automated strain engineering, high-throughput screening, analytical chemistry, fermentation, and bioinformatics groups to build and test engineered strainsAnalyze scientific literature and in-house historical data to identify and examine hypotheses to improve strain performance; collaborate with bioinformatics/AI group to deepen learning from large datasetsAnalyze data from rich phenotype + genotype datasets, and apply knowledge of cellular metabolism and physiology, to design additional DNA designs (i.e., genotypes) for the next round of strain engineeringManage and coordinate complex experimental schedules within a broader teamMentor, train, and possibly manage more junior scientistsMaintain safe practices and work environmentQualifications We require candidates with formal technical training (Ph.D. or equivalent experience) in metabolic engineering, microbiology, molecular biology, biochemistry, chemistry, chemical engineering, or a related field. The ideal candidate will have >5 years post-Ph.D. relevant experience, preferably in an industrial setting. We prefer candidates with a history of successfully engineering metabolism or signaling, and iteratively improving strain performance. Previous experience in the field of microbial genome engineering and/or synthetic biology is a plus. The successful candidate will have expertise in some or all of the following areas: Cellular physiology and metabolism in microbesCellular processes involved in small molecule production, including redox balance, energetics, product transport, growth rate, fermentation conditions, overflow metabolism, etc.Enzymology and protein engineeringMolecular biology techniques, including PCR, restriction digest analysis, design and execution of cloning experiments, DNA assembly methods, plasmid construction, DNA sequence analysis, nuclease-triggered DNA recombination, microbial transformation, and genomic DNA analyses (in bacteria and/or yeast)Concepts in statistics and tools to analyze data (e.g., Excel, Minitab, R, Spotfire, JMP)Experience working productively as part of a cross-disciplinary, collaborative teamDemonstrated high productivity and track record of research success Amyris, a leader in industrial synthetic biology, uses its innovative bioscience solutions to achieve renewable products by converting plant sugars into hydrocarbon molecules.
