The selected individual will execute innovative research to understand molecular-scale processed occurring at mineral-water interfaces and in geomaterials through the use, application, and development of coherent X-ray scattering techniques. Also, they will be responsible for developing innovative experimental apparatus and conceptual approaches for such studies using high brilliance synchrotron radiation. Interprets experimental data and presents results at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed literature. Position Requirements  Successful applicants will have: Considerable knowledge of the use and application of coherent X-ray scattering.Considerable knowledge of interfacial science, low-temperature geochemistry or materials science.Considerable knowledge in experimental techniques in interfacial science; and mathematical techniques and computer programming for data analysis.Considerable knowledge of synchrotron-based x-ray scattering and spectroscopy techniques for in situ and operando studies.Considerable skill and knowledge in devising, performing, and evaluating innovative research using in-situ and operando observations. Considerable skill in working interactively and productively in a multidisciplinary environment.Considerable skill in oral and written communication.Considerable ability to work independently.Considerable record of publication and external recognition in these areas.Excellent skill in the use and maintenance of laboratory equipment and in technical communications.Good ability to supervise activities of students and graduate students. This level of knowledge is typically achieved through a formal education in X-ray physics, materials science, interfacial chemistry, or geochemistry at the Ph.D. degree level with zero to two years of experience or equivalent in the scientific application of this knowledge and practical laboratory experience.  This position may require the ability to travel for work at out-of-state synchrotron facilities.
