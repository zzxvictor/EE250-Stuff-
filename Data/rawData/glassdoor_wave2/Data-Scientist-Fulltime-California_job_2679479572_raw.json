Join our growing team of computational biologists in translating genetic discoveries into insights into molecular biology of human traits and diseases! Who you are We are looking for a colleague with extensive experience in computational biology and human genomics. Biological interpretation of the unparalleled wealth of genetic signals requires efficient computational methods that augment our database with public or internally generated high-throughput genomic or functional data. Ideal candidates will use rigorous quantitative reasoning, creativity, and understanding of biological systems to develop robust tools that drive discovery and interpretation. They will have significant experience in analyzing large genomic datasets using the best practices in machine learning or statistics. Our team is very collaborative, and the ability to communicate ideas and results to other scientists is key. Scientific questions we are working on, and the scope of our vision mean that most of the necessary tools and methods have yet to be developed anywhere in the world.  In addition, candidates for senior scientists should have multiple years of experience leading development and implementation of novel methods and bioinformatics tools, executing independently developed ideas, and a demonstrated ability to clearly and effectively communicate with a wide range of internal and external audiences.  We encourage presentation and publication of research results. The full list of our publications can be seen at https://research.23andme.com/publications/.
