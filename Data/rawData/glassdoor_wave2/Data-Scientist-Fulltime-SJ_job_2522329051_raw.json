There is no busy work. Every project that our interns work on is important to the company and its goals.Because Quora is such a data-driven company, our data scientists play a central role in the product development process by uncovering key insights from our data. As a data scientist, you'll work closely with engineers, product designers, and product managers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, design randomized controlled experiments, build visualizations, and tackle hard, open-ended problems. You'll also develop tools and infrastructure to scale and automate the analyses that enable rapid product iteration. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. We use a variety of tools--primarily Python and SQL--to analyze data and communicate results with the rest of the company.We also realize that mentorship is important to allow interns to grow and develop skills in new areas. Every intern will have a full-time data scientist as a mentor and weekly 1:1s with their managers to get feedback and ensure things are going well.Things we look for include:Pursuing a B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in a scientific or quantitative fieldExcellent statistical intuition and knowledge of various analytical approachesCuriosity and passion for QuoraSuperb communication skills and ability to explain your analysis clearlyProficiency in SQLFamiliarity with Python or similar scripting languagePassion for learning and always improving yourself and the team around you"}
