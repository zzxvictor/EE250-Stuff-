ID: 112982  As a Senior Surface Scientist in Micron\u2019s Surface Analysis Lab located in Boise, Idaho, you will utilize various analytical tools, primarily related to AFM, to provide essential support to Technology Development (TD) research groups and enable them to develop new processes and materials as well as support various manufacturing activities to expedite improved yields and process monitoring. This position would primarily be responsible to develop and provide advanced scanning probe microscopy analysis in support of all aspects of semiconductor and micro-electronics manufacture and development at Micron. It would also include technical oversight of associate scientists and technicians who are responsible for providing the bulk of the routine AFM analyses. In addition to typical topographical scanning, some of the other techniques required are SSRM, SCM, C-AFM, PFM, EFM, and QNM.\u00a0  \u00a0  Your responsibilities will include, but are not limited to, the following:  \u00a0  Take ownership of one or more equipment types related to the development and operation of AFM based techniques: Contribute expert subject area knowledge to resolve issues and solve highly complex problems by documenting potentially innovative solutions to new equipment modifications and process research, etc.Lead significant projects to support technical innovation in areas such as process or product application that can be delivered across multiple manufacturing sites.Implement changes to technologies and services to improve metrics in scrap, cost, rework, cycle time, throughput or yield. \u00a0  Resolve complex integration issues through process development: Identify and evaluate interactions between equipment and processes and resolve related issues.Impact: Achieve end results for significant projects without which there will be an inability to reach crucial organizational objectives and would profoundly affect the image of the organization. \u00a0  Set process level roadmap to drive improvement and technical innovation and implement new strategies and processes as they relate to TD strategic objectives: Define and lead complex, multi-disciplinary projects of critical importance to the organization such as managing area specific, technical project roadmaps. \u00a0  Identify alternatives by continually improving design and reliability: Recognize opportunities and provide feedback to TD personnel for technical innovation. \u00a0  Mentor new surface analysis engineers and technicians.  \u00a0  Drive development and improvement by formulating data needs and developing new methods and procedures: Standardize methods and procedures across area, department and/or manufacturing sites. \u00a0  Establish clear and strong lines of communication allowing a quick response to customer requirements. Interact positively with the Lab team, development engineering, vendors, manufacturing, management, and senior customers on matters requiring coordination across organizational boundaries: Interact on a regular basis with counterparts in manufacturing.Understand manufacturing issues.Interact with manufacturing and TD on projects.Transfer owned process to manufacturing with good support and documentation.Act as a \u2018go to person\u2019 for materials analysis issues related to AFM. \u00a0  Safety: Identify and promptly report hazardsFollow safety procedures and area work rules including proper PPE, lockout and chemical safety.Operate and maintain equipment and tools within manufacturer\u2019s and company guidelinesUse proper lifting techniques and work in an ergonomically correct manner \u00a0  Requirements: Education: PhD in Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Chemistry or related field. (Master\u2019s degree would be considered with extensive AFM experience)Experience: At least 5 years of experience working with AFM toolsets.
