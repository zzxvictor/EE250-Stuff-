You will be responsible for targeting a range of technologies, such as phase change memory, resistive memory, spin torque transistor memory, three dimensional memories, Crosspoint, etc., both for non-volatile, and volatile memories. Additionally, you will be responsible for the development of reliability models for customer usage, acceleration factor modeling, detection methods, qualification methods, etc. Further, you will assimilate data from multiple groups (design, process, reliability, product engineers, probe and test, etc.) to develop the reliability models. Your responsibilities will include, but are not limited to:  CMOS Reliability modeling, including:  Design reliability experiments and coordinate their execution;  Develop concepts for reliability testing of new mechanisms;  Analyze and model array reliability for single mechanisms and combining multiple mechanisms;  Develop methods of acceleration factors;  Develop a predictive model for failure mechanisms combining customer usage models and a comprehensive failure model.  Minimum Qualifications:  Knowledge or experience with device physics and CMOS including: process and integration challenges of scaled devices, non-ideal characteristics, electrical characterization.  Knowledge or experience with solid state device physics, including: MOSFETs, Tunnel FETs and Steep Slope devices.  Thorough understanding of mainstream memory technologies such as dynamic random access memories (DRAM), NAND, NOR, and static random access memories acquired through significant industry experience.  Knowledge of Thin-Oxides failure mechanisms and models.  Basic understanding of semiconductor process technology such as thin film deposition like CVD and PVD, wet processing, implant, reactive ion etching, Chemical mechanical polishing etc,.  Knowledge or experience in semiconductor characterization like MOSFETs, MOSCAPs using parametric analyzers such as 4156, 4284 etc,.  Knowledge of memory related product operation, timings, datasheets, testing, etc.  Understanding of cutting-edge emerging memory cells.  Knowledge or experience with failure modes related to transistors and memory cell related reliability mechanisms including: bias temperature instability (BTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), stress induced leakage currents (SILC).  Strong understanding of fundamental chemistry and physics related to reliability failure modes.  Very strong skills associated with reliability modeling including data analysis, design of experiments, and associated software such as (JMP, R, etc.).  Strong experience in statistical data analysis with understanding of statistical hypotheses testing such as Student\u2019s t-test, ANOVA, and Tukey HSD.
