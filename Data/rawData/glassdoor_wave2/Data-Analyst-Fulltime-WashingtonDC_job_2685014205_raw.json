From the summer before 9th grade through college graduation, our 10-year program removes the barriers that prevent students from earning their college degree by providing them with comprehensive academic support, leadership training, financial and college advising, and scholarships. We teach them the skills necessary to succeed in college and beyond. In four years, a College Track student receives support equivalent to one extra year of high school.  College Track started in 1997 with a cohort of 25 students in East Palo Alto. Today, we serve over 2,800 high school and college students in East Palo Alto, Oakland, San Francisco, New Orleans, Colorado, Los Angeles and Sacramento. By 2020, we will double the number of students we serve and produce nearly 1,000 college graduates. Last year, 96% of our high school seniors were accepted to four-year colleges and our college graduation rate is 2.5 times the national average for low-income students.  About College Track Prince George's County  This year, College Track will expand to our 10th location - and first on the East Coast, thanks to a 10 year, $10 million commitment from Kevin Durant to bring our college completion program to his hometown of Prince George's County, Maryland. Our partnership with the Kevin Durant Charity Foundation and Prince George's County Public Schools presents a unique opportunity to change the narrative for many students and place them on the path to upward social mobility.  College Track @ The Durant Center will celebrate its grand opening in the fall of 2018 with a cohort of 60 students from Suitland High School. It will be the first of three to open in the D.C. metro area by 2021.
