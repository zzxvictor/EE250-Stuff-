Were demonstrating we are a new kind of organisation, resetting expectations of what a bio-pharmaceutical company can do and following the science. Were continually exploring new ways to work, pioneering cutting edge approaches and bringing diverse teams together to deliver exceptional results which are changing the way diseases are treated.  At AstraZeneca, we don't follow the crowd and we dont expect our people to either. To develop life-changing medicines and make a difference to patients we approach problems in a different way agile and nimble, and focused on what our people need to make ground-breaking discoveries and accelerate the development and launch of new medicines.  The decisions that AstraZeneca makes throughout its value chain are best when informed by data. As part of the Global Medicines Development (GMD) Transformation initiative, AstraZeneca is investing in data science to drive efficiencies, optimize our workflows, and improve our decision making.  GMD started its transformation journey in 2016, launching several programmes which are already achieving significant benefits. GMD will accelerate its transformation along four strategic areas, making us more efficient, faster, and delivering medicines at even higher quality by:  \u2022Innovating the approach to drug development programmes (e.g., automated and digitized patient and investigator data collection, eliminating manual data handling post data capture)  \u2022Laying the foundation for new evidence generation beyond RCTs (e.g. using registry data)  \u2022Automating manual processes by more than 50% to free up time for scientific activities (e.g. automated case handling, auto population of submission relevant materials)  \u2022Making a step change towards higher-quality and more predictive decisions based on integrated data as a foundation (e.g. simulate trials and select sites and patients based on predictive analytics)  The Advanced Analytics Centre (AAC) is a GMD hub of data science experts who develop and deliver cutting-edge methods which address critical scientific and business questions in drug development. , partnering with Clinical Operations so that we can all achieve more together. We aim to employ advanced predictive techniques and fit-for-purpose decision frameworks. In parallel we will establish real-time in-depth multivariate statistical metrics and visualizations for in-flight clinical trial monitoring  We need your insight, expertise and leadership to help shape a future in which data will exponentially increase in volume, be more accessible and the opportunities for value creation will be endless. That will require state of the art analytical methodologies to optimize decision making.
