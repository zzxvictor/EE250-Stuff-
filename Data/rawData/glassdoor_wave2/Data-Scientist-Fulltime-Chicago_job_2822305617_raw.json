Builds R and D team to perform basic research in computational biology, systems biology and/or cancer biology with the goal of applying computational techniques to improve understanding of living systems at multiple scales. Develops a network of collaborations to participate in complex multi-disciplinary projects that typically span multiple institutions. Participates in the conception and implementation of research programs in computational biology as part of an integrated, multi-institution research team. Executes research with potential to build and direct a research group that applies computational approaches to improve understanding of living systems at the molecular and population levels. Develops new methods in computational biology; applies machine-learning techniques to problems in genomics to understand and predict how living systems respond to treatments and changing environments. Interacts with experimental researchers to discover new ways to integrate and analyze experimental data. Reports on results of research including publishing scholarly papers in scientific journals and giving presentations at symposia, conferences, meetings, and seminars. Reports on research progress and new initiatives to division management, review committees, and funding agencies. Collaborates with scientists within the division, lab-wide, as well as with other laboratories, universities, and industry on basic research, computational biology, metabolic modeling, genome analysis, and systems biology issues. Participates in the formulation and implementation of interdisciplinary research activities, identifying sources of funding, and proposal writing. Participates in professional activities for professional development including serving on committees, participating actively in professional societies, reviewing proposals, refereeing manuscripts, and serving on editorial boards and review committees.
