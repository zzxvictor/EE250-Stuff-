Today\u2019s air traffic management is evolving into a more demanding and complex airspace environment than when it was first designed. As air traffic demand continues to grow, it is projected that there will be increases in terms of passenger delays, impact on the environment and costs to flight operators, as well as higher and more complex workload demands on air traffic service providers, and new innovative types of operations (large volumes of unmanned aerial systems, urban air mobility eVTOL vehicles etc.). Researchers and service providers must find ways to increase airspace capacity and flexibility. Position Summary: The Researcher/Data Scientist will support aeronautics research developing the next-generation air transportation system for both conventional aircraft and unmanned aircraft systems through development and integration of advanced autonomy and software systems. Our team works closely with the FAA and aviation industry to enable development and testing of future capabilities.  The Researcher/Data Scientist will contribute to the Aviation Systems team to develop multiple aspects of research in air traffic management to meet the demands of air traffic service providers, with a particular focus on analytics, including machine learning applications, operations research, simulation and analysis. Essential Duties/Responsibilities:Conduct research, development, and evaluation of advanced air traffic control and management automation concepts.Apply machine learning methods, numerical algorithms and optimization techniques in the analysis and development of new automation concepts.Interact with the customer to execute research plans, including requirements, design & development, schedules, milestones, deliverables, and satisfaction.Deliver monthly progress report and metrics.Publish as first or second author in peer-reviewed technical papers and journals.Present own research at seminars and conferencesWork productively in a team environmentRequired Qualifications:Education: M.S. in Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or related degree preferred.
