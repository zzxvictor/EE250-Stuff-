We are a team of high performers with diverse backgrounds\u2014our roster includes marketers, economists, computer scientists, mathematicians, psychologists, and more. While our degrees may be different, we all share a passion for data and a desire to make an impact. We are looking for talented, curious, and creative Data Scientists to join our growing team.  You will be part of the decision and data science function for VALIC: including contributing to the development of predictive analytics, customer segmentation methodologies, marketing targeting, attribution and response models, as well as the evaluation of new data sources and perform advanced data processing technologies.  What you will do:  You will carry out data processing and analysis including statistical analysis, variable selection, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, etc.  Build predictive models utilizing both traditional statistical methods (Generalized Linear Models,  Mixed Effects Models, Ridge, Lasso, etc.) and modern machine learning techniques (Gradient  Boosted Trees, Random Forests, Kernel methods, Deep Learning, etc.). You will help with the design, development, evaluation and monitoring of predictive models and advanced algorithms that help business to drive decisions throughout the customer lifecycle (prospecting, acquisition,  interactions, fraud, etc).  You will apply your technical data/ETL/programming skills to ingest, wrangle and explore external and internal data to create reports, function as the data expert and prepare data for modeling and support production deployment of models OR apply your technical modeling skills to build worldclass predictive models for solving tangible business problems.  Extract, clean, and manipulate large datasets (structured and unstructured) for model building.  Communicate (written and verbal) insights from quantitative analyses to technical and non-technical  audiences.  Stay current on the latest machine learning and big data trends.  Work with business sponsors and IT teams to implement analytic solutions.  Train, mentor, and lead junior data scientists.  Serve as a technical expert on one or more domains (e.g. Time Series Analysis, Text Mining, etc.)  You will leverage methods from diverse disciplines like machine learning, statistical modeling, information theory, information retrieval and other areas to gain customer insights, draw conclusions and work with business partners to put those insights into action.
