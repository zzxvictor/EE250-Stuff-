Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities we're just getting started.  At the heart of connecting people together is building a platform that fosters sharing between you and family, friends, and community; the mission of the Sharing Organization at Facebook is to do just that. The Sharing Ecosystem teams job is to step back, and tackle deep, challenging questions that'll help inform our understanding of sharing on Facebook and the barriers. Questions like: whats driving the sharing decline on Facebook, how much of this is from competition, from increasing audience concerns, from politicization of Facebook and changes in sentiment and brand; how do we use our understanding of sharing drivers to make accurate, non-linear forecasts; we know women and children are most susceptible to harassment and bullying - how does this impact their propensity to share, how do we detect and mitigate this in the future? This team is unique in that its not directly tied to a product team, which provides the team with the space to dive deep into these topics. The ideal candidate is someone who is a deep systems thinker, and is someone who is looking for a role that is more research heavy. Responsibilities:"}
