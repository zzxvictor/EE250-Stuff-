Over the last 2.5 years, our team has worked to develop the world's most accurate pricing engine for short-term rentals. We use this pricing engine to power an increasing set of product lines, including Wheelhouse Pricing. Building this pricing engine required (and still requires) us to borrow from a wide range of statistics and ML approaches, including methodologies we found in bio-sciences and other distributed realms.  Now, we're looking to add another data scientist who is passionate about building interpretable machine learning models, and taking them from research to production. These models help our software customers price their homes accurately, and also serve as the foundation of our relationships with many of the world's largest real estate companies.  Our data science team is closely integrated with the engineering team, and we are not shy of full stack tasks from DevOps to front-end integrations. We use open source and homegrown tools in a cloud environment to build the data-driven foundation of all our products.  We currently use Postgres, Redis, R, Ruby/Rails, React, AWS - so in depth experience in any of these areas is definitely a plus.
