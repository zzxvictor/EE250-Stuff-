Millions of people already use our platform, but to keep growing we always need to get smarter about learning from our data. This is the critical role that product scientists serve at Medium.What is \u201cProduct Science\u201d?Depending on what company you talk to, a \u201cdata\u201d group could mean many different things. At Medium, Product Science is the central team responsible for every step of translating data into insights that improve the product.Sound broad? It is! We build the data pipelines and infrastructure, create tools to query and visualize it, analyze experiments and trends, and develop algorithms that feed back into the product. We have one foot in engineering and the other in product development, which gives us the breadth to directly impact the product.While most of our work isn\u2019t public, we can share a few examples of what we\u2019ve been up to:Total Time Reading, a metric we designed and built internally to guide product decisionsCharted, an open-source tool for making quick chartsOptimal Post Length, an example of the kinds of questions product scientists help answerYou can find more examples in our Data Lab publicationThis focus on data is baked into Medium\u2019s culture, and our thoughtfulness about analytics extends to the top of the company.What is the Product Scientist role?Broadly, product scientists focus on analysis\u200a\u2014\u200ainterpreting data, sharing insights, and developing models that improve the product. We work together to analyze patterns at a macro level, answering questions the rest of the company hasn\u2019t thought to ask yet. On a day-to-day basis, you\u2019ll spend half of your time with product teams: a group of engineers, designers, a product manager, and you, the product scientist, all working together in a small group to build new features. You\u2019ll extract key data and findings, define metrics, evaluate A|B tests, identify opportunities based on the data, and share new insights no one considered before. You\u2019ll be right there, brainstorming with the team, thinking ahead, ensuring we make the best data-informed decisions.The other half of your time will be spent with us, the Product Science team, enhancing our general analytics. You\u2019ll keep us ahead of the needs for those product efforts, making sure we instrument the data correctly. You\u2019ll also build tools and algorithms (like reading recommendations, or total time reading) to expand the team\u2019s capabilities. And\u200a\u2014\u200aalways important\u200a\u2014\u200ayou\u2019ll simply explore Medium\u2019s rich dataset.What kind of people are hired for this role?We need the essentials: strong attention to detail, excellent written and oral communication skills to articulate insights, and great problem solving with thoughtful approaches. Product scientists should also have technical depth; data analysis experience (ideally with consumer web products) is necessary for this role. It\u2019d be great if you understand the intuition behind the statistical methods used to evaluate AB-tests, pinpoint the underlying factors contributing to a metric\u2019s growth and regularly use a few of these languages: SQL, JavaScript, Python and/or Scala (it\u2019d be a bonus if you\u2019ve hacked together a tool or interactive visualization yourself).We work from the Medium offices in San Francisco and we\u2019d love to hear from you; please send us your resume here."}
