With the advent of genomic sequencing, we can finally measure and process our genetic makeup. We now have more data than ever before but providers don't have the infrastructure or expertise to make sense of said data, let alone use their extensive patient charting to complement the data achieved through genome sequencing. Here at Tempus, we believe that the wholistic approach for the detection and treatment of cancer lies in the deep understanding of molecular activity coupled with the ability to use the latest NLP and predictive modeling techniques to extract information and insights from the patient\u2019s chart.  Our Natural Language Processing Data Scientist will use state of the art techniques to process and analyze vast amounts of clinical data in a way it has never been done before. They\u2019ll also help create a highly scalable infrastructure to house billions of records from the ground up. We\u2019re looking for someone who will collaborate with product, research, and business development teams to develop the most advanced data fusion platform in cancer care.  What you'll do: Design and develop clinical NLP methods that ingest large unstructured clinical data sets, separate signal from noise, and provide personalized insights at the patient level that directly improve our analytics platformDevelop innovative methods for processing and storing dataInterrogate analytical results to resolve algorithmic success, robustness and validity Requirements: PhD or equivalent work experience in statistics, computer science, bioinformatics or related fieldExperience with a variety of NLP methods for information extraction, topic modeling, parsing, and relationship extractionFamiliarity with developing, deploying, and maintaining production NLP models with scalability in mindExperience with knowledge databases and language ontologiesQuantitative training in probability, statistics and machine learning Classical statistical tools, machine learning algorithms, ensemble methodsAnalytical development and programming skills Python, R, Javascript, or LuaReproducible research methodsExperience in genomics is a plus, especially experience with next-generation sequencing data processing and modelingGoal-oriented thinkingGreat problem solving skillsSelf-driven and works well in an interdisciplinary team with minimal directionExperience with communicating insights and presenting concepts to a diverse audience"}
