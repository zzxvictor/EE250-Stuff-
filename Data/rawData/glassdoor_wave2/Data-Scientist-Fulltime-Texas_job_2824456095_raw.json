Come and join us to help build the most stunning images of the Earth's subsurface, using our massive computers capability. Thanks to our talented people and in-house technology, CGG is unique in the geoscience sector. Job Description CGG is currently looking for a creative and results-focused individual who enjoys working on open-ended problems. Your customers are world-class seismic imagers who strive to image the subsurface with a high degree of accuracy and resolution. Your challenge is to analyze the computational activities and demands of seismic imaging and, with your insights, propose solutions and applications for realms widely ranging from resource scheduling and allocations to automation of imaging-related computations in our HPC environment. In a nutshell, we expect you to propose solutions to known problems and also identify new areas where you can add value with your expertise.  We want people who can work with a team to decide what to look for, and who also have the technical ability to go get it. Interest in data mining and machine learning is key, since these are the two areas where you may specialize. You will participate as an engineer on a development team, writing, testing, and deploying code to achieve your goals. We want you if you are an independent thinker and capable of analyzing requirements, extracting data for analysis, and developing algorithms and tools. We process seismic data at the petascale and warehouse information at the terascale. The stakes are high, but your impact can be higher.
