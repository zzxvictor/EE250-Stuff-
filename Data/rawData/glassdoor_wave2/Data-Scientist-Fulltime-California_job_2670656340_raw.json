Using an industrial scale fermentation process, our microbes convert cheap sugars into a wide variety of high value target molecules, including medicines, fuels, and commodity chemicals. While providing low cost, high quality malaria medication and renewable substitutes for fuels and chemicals, our end products directly impact millions of lives while reducing humanity's carbon footprint. We are pragmatic idealists seeking a profitable way to make the world a better place.  Within Amyris R&D;, we are searching for a highly energetic, curious, and self-motivated scientist with a strong background in statistics, computing and biology to join our Scientific Computing team. Research at Amyris is a highly multidisciplinary effort that needs brilliant contributions from life sciences and engineering disciplines in order to take projects from concept to market. From hacking directly on DNA in the lab to full scale factory production, every aspect of our work is facilitated and accelerated by quantitative science and software & hardware automation. Scientific Computing helps bench scientists design better microbial strains using genotype specification languages and high-level functional ontologies of parts and pathways; and helps model & learn from high-throughput, multivariate phenotype, NGS, and \u2018omics data to rapidly drive the design-build-test-learn cycle. Key ResponsibilitiesIteratively develop computational algorithms, analysis and visualization tools to meet evolving scientific needs and to aid rapid data-driven decision making. Data types include: genotype (NGS), phenotype (metabolomics, proteomics, GC/MS, spectroscopy, fermentation), material flowBuild version-controlled, computable workflows to analyze rich, high-throughput phenotype dataInteract closely with biology, analytical chemistry, and fermentation scientistsCollaborate with automation engineers and software developers of in-house enterprise systems to mine experimental data and metadataRequired QualificationsDegree in quantitative discipline such as computer science, mathematics, computational biology, electrical engineering, bioengineering. Ph.D. plus 2-4 years experience, or M.S. plus 8 years experience. Industry experience strongly preferred.At least three years experience in analyzing & visualizing large scientific datasets representing biological & chemical phenotypesIndustrial programming experience, i.e. having written or maintained large codebase using software best practices (e.g. unit tests) and distributed version controlExpert coder in either Python or ROutstanding communication and interpersonal skillsAbility to thrive in a fast-paced yet intellectually rigorous environmentCreativity, independent thinking, and passionExperience with the following a plusBackground in mass spectrometry informatics, HTS, spectrophotometry, or industrial fermentationExperience in a microbiology or synthetic biology setting Amyris, a leader in industrial synthetic biology, uses its innovative bioscience solutions to achieve renewable products by converting plant sugars into hydrocarbon molecules. Amyris\u2019 molecules are used in wide range of specialty & performance chemicals, flavors & fragrances and in applications ranging from cosmetics to biofuels. Learn more at www.amyris.com.
