Through our family of apps and services, we're building a different kind of company that connects billions of people around the world, gives them ways to share what matters most to them, and helps bring people closer together. Whether we're creating new products or helping a small business expand its reach, people at Facebook are builders at heart. Our global teams are constantly iterating, solving problems, and working together to empower people around the world to build community and connect in meaningful ways. Together, we can help people build stronger communities we're just getting started.At the heart of connecting people together is building a platform that fosters sharing between you and family, friends, and community. Industry wide, weve seen Stories as a new sharing/consumption format rise. One of the top priorities for Facebook this year will be leaning into this trend and making sure that Facebook is a Stories first product. With this change means disrupting the existing ecosystem within Facebook; it means shifting peoples sharing behaviors to be more visual and less text-heavy; it means changing the way people consume content from their friends and family and moving away from a News Feed format; itll mean learning how to monetize this new format to mitigate expected revenue cannibalization from News Feed, etc. We need a Data Scientist who is capable of tackling all aspects of this problem. As Data Scientist on the team, youll be expected to stretch across growth, engagement, and monetization of Stories, and work with data scientists to help the company execute this major shift.
