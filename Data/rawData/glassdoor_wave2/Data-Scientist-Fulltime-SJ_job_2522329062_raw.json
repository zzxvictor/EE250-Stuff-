As a data scientist, you'll work closely with engineers, product designers, and product managers to devise appropriate measurements and metrics, design randomized controlled experiments, build visualizations, and tackle hard, open-ended problems. You'll also develop tools and infrastructure to scale and automate the analyses that enable rapid product iteration. Quora has a wide range of rich data, giving you ample room for exploration and creativity. Examples of some projects our data scientists have worked on include modeling our long-term growth, improving the relevance and personalization of the homepage feed, and exploratory factor analysis of user behavior. We use a variety of tools--primarily Python and SQL--to analyze data and communicate results with the rest of the company.While Quora's data scientists come from a variety of backgrounds, including chemical engineering, mathematics, and physics, we all share a love for data and continuous learning. Especially in your first role post-graduation, we realize that mentorship is important for professional growth and development. Every data scientist has a mentor and weekly 1:1s with their managers to get feedback and ensure things are going well.For examples of data science work, see Quora's Data blog: https://data.quora.com/Things we look for include:B.S., M.S., Ph.D. in a scientific or quantitative field, for example: Statistics, Computer Science, Physics or Cognitive ScienceExcellent statistical intuition and knowledge of various analytical approachesCuriosity and passion for QuoraSuperb communication skills and ability to explain your analysis clearlyProficiency in SQLProficient with Python or similar scripting languageExperience in working with large data sets and distributed computing tools (Hive, Redshift) is a plusPassion for learning and always improving yourself and the team around you"}
