Our employees are not  only part of history, they're making history.  Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems  has an opening for an Architect Modeling Engineer Systems Engineer 3. This  position will be located in Redondo  Beach, CA.  The individual in this role will  perform architecture modeling and analysis activities in the Systems Analysis  & Simulation (SE&I;) IPT of the GS&MS; organization. This individual  will be responsible for developing and maintaining architecture modeling  capability for captures and programs across the sector. This person will serve  as a subject matter expert for small programs, trade studies, and CRAD  activities that need architecture modeling. Their expertise isavailable  to lead architecture modeling efforts on small projects, CRAD, and IRAD efforts. Essential DutiesApply architecture frameworks and concepts uniformly  across all sector programsWork with Model Based System Engineering efforts by the  functional team to leverage current architecture modeling tool sets.Establish and maintain a repository (unclassified and  classified where possible) of architecture modeling data for rapid starts  on new projectsBridge architecture models with physics based  performance simulations and with campaign modeling efforts across the  SA&S; IPT to develop a Models Based or model-centric engineering  approach The goal is to facilitate and share  models and simulations across all new projects. This lead will collaborate with  the RTE functions and COEs to spread architecture modeling fundamentals. Some  travel will be required in this position. Responsibilities includeCreating and implementing a roadmap to fulfill sector  need to utilize common architecture modeling frameworks and concepts for  analysis and strategic decision making.Develop a common repository of architecture modeling  data and structures.Provide technical leadership on funded studies that  have architecture modeling scope.Develop and review documentation related to  architecture modeling and tool usage, assumptions, and limitations.
