Our purpose as a company is to discover and develop therapies that will change the course of human health. We value our passion for patients, quest for innovation, spirit of independence and love of challenge. With a presence in more than 70 countries, and growing - we look for talented people to grow our business, advance our science and contribute to our unique culture.  We seek a talented, collaborative inter-disciplinary scientist to work on the computational analysis of asset-specific molecular profiling data in understanding observations in early translational trials. This individual will play a key scientific role leveraging innovative computational analysis and rich patient data to empower data-driven decisions for therapeutic programs in Employers Immunology & Inflammation (I&I;) Thematic Center of Excellence (TCoE).  This position plays a critical role in providing deep insight into therapeutic mechanisms of action, patient selection, and indication prioritization as pipeline assets transition into the clinics. Analysis scenarios will involve exploratory clinical data and output from transcriptomic, proteomic, genomic, and a wide range of innovative cell-molecular profiling platforms. Successful candidate will also have the unique opportunity to back translate into early discovery given a rich pipeline, active investment into human cohort consortia and active systematic efforts integrating public datasets. Areas of particular focus include: elucidation of pharmacogenomics and pharmacodynamics hypotheses derived from trial data; methods to highlight clear mechanistic differentiation of Employer assets comparing to existing therapeutics in key indications; and predictive patient stratification to identify subgroups of unmet medical need and/or enriched therapeutic response via machine learning analysis of molecular profiling data.  The position would suit an individual with strong scientific rigor, creativity, excellent communication and collaboration skills. Applications are encouraged from those involved in innovative translational research for complex indications in clinical or industrial research environments. The role offers the opportunity to impact directly the delivery of truly transformational and life-changing therapies in key diseases of unmet medical need. Responsibilities Working in collaboration with computational, biological and clinical scientists across the Employer Research and Early Development organization, responsibilities include but are not limited to:  \u00b7 Pursuit of leading computational biology research towards key Employer scientific objectives.  \u00b7 Active participation as a core team member in the RIKU Research Analytics group and focused collaboration with translational researchers in our I&I; Thematic Center of Excellence (TCoE).  \u00b7 Coordinated application of novel computational analysis and biological interpretation approaches to leverage internal, public and partner datasets and empower data-driven decisions across therapeutic programs.  \u00b7 Multi-disciplinary collaboration to investigate compound and disease properties, influence decision making across the translational research and clinical development process, and feedback to inform early development of novel therapies.  \u00b7 Execute the development of molecular patient selection and biomarker hypotheses towards clinical diagnostics.  \u00b7 Participation in and oversight of scientific report writing. Presentation of methods, results and conclusions to a publishable standard.  \u00b7 Contribution to planning and execution of collaborative projects with leading academic and commercial research groups worldwide. Background experience & complementary knowledge \u00b7 A Ph.D. in computational biology, bioinformatics, or related field from a recognized higher-education establishment.  \u00b7 5+ years post-doctoral experience of inter-disciplinary computational and molecular biomarker research in university, hospital or biotechnology environments.  \u00b7 3+ years experience in pharma/biotech research environment preferable.  \u00b7 Strong knowledge required of predictive analytical practice and molecular diagnostic development. Working knowledge of clinical statistics desirable.  \u00b7 Previous experience of research supervision and track record of peer-reviewed publication in relevant scientific journals.  \u00b7 Expertise in algorithmic implementation, statistical programming and data manipulation, using e.g. R/Bioconductor, Matlab, Python, and contemporary, open-source bioinformatics tools and database structures.  \u00b7 Proven problem-solving skills, collaborative nature and adaptability across disciplines.  \u00b7 Excellent verbal and written communication skills.
