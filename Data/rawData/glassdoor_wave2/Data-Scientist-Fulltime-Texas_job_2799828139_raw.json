Our interests are in enabling data science and search based applications on large and low latent data sets in both a batch and streaming context for processing.  To that end, this role will engage with team counterparts in exploring and deploying technologies for creating data sets using a combination of batch and streaming transformation processes. These data sets support both off-line and in-line machine learning training and model execution. Other data sets support search engine based analytics. Exploration and deployment of technologies activities include identifying opportunities that impact business strategy, selecting data solutions software, and defining hardware requirements based on business requirements. Responsibility also includes coding, testing, and documentation of new or modified scalable analytic data systems including automation for deployment and monitoring. This role participates along with team counterparts to architect an end-to-end framework developed on a group of core data technologies. Other aspects of the role include developing standards and processes for data engineering projects and initiatives.
