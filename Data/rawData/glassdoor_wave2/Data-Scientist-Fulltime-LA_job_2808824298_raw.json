USC operates one of the world\u2019s largest academic high-performance computing clusters. ISI has three research campuses: one in Marina del Rey, CA, one in Arlington, VA, and one in Waltham, MA. *This position is located in Arlington, VA* Information Sciences Institute (ISI) is looking for highly talented, motivated researchers to lead and impact state-of-the-art research and development in the area of reconfigurable computing. The Reconfigurable Computing Group (RCG) is a pioneer of research related to field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) including architecture, tools, applications, hardware trust, and security. It works closely with leading agencies such as DARPA, IARPA, and NASA where reconfigurable computing is a critical technology. Spanning the days of homogeneous logic devices to today\u2019s billion transistor system on a chip devices, RCG has led the way from being the first to implement application-level partial runtime reconfiguration, investigating 3D FPGA architectures, developing autonomous system on chip architectures, releasing open source CAD tools that target real physical devices, and IP to address software/hardware co-design complexity. Today, RCG is addressing our nation\u2019s challenges in big data, hardware cybersecurity, trusted systems, cognitive radio and more.  This position will lead the research and technical direction of RCG\u2019s thrust in Abstractions for Reconfigurable Computing, which enable traditional software developers to develop FPGA and ASIC designs and increase the productivity of hardware designers. Architect and lead the development of complex platform tools which support highly specialized domains. Perform research on ground breaking CAD solutions, including integration with higher level hardware/software co-design and HLS solutions, and deployment in Amazon AWS F-1. Realize effectiveness of solutions on physical FPGAs and custom ASIC fabrication. Lead research, propose major innovations, collaborate with peers within the group and across ISI, publish results in top tier conferences, and contribute to or lead proposals.
