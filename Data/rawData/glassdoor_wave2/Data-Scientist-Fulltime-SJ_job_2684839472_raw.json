In this role, you will lead and participate in cross functional teams contributing to the development of IVD and LDT products under design control, in accordance with ISO 13485 and Good Manufacturing and Laboratory Practices (GMP/GLP). You will participate in requirements definition, risk analysis, reagent and QC method development, manufacturing development and scale-up, optimization, troubleshooting, and verification and validation activities related to manufacturing and quality control testing.  The high complexity nature of the work demands in-depth understanding of reagent and consumable development, manufacturing, and analytical and functional test methods for quality control, and strong working knowledge of ISO 13485 and other applicable regulatory requirements for medical devices such as PMA and 510(k). This position requires excellent leadership, collaboration, written and verbal communication skills, attention to detail, ability to multi-task, and flexibility to adapt to changes in priority and schedules are essential. RESPONSIBILITIESLead and participate in efforts to support the development of IVD products under design control in conformance with ISO 13485(2016) or FDA PMA or 501(k) requirements. Partner with Genomic Sciences, Biostatistics, and other functions in the development and use of appropriate test methods for characterizing the composition, functional performance, and stability of reagents and consumables required for the  development and launch of new products. Collaborate closely with colleagues in Quality, Supply Chain Management, Biostatistics, Process Engineering, R&D;, and other functions to facilitate effective, efficient process transfer and ensure supplier and OEM vendor quality. Partner with Supply Chain, Legal, and Quality personnel to effectively establish and manage Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) relationships for reagent manufacturing. Create required documents such as reagent manufacturing and quality control testing procedures, incoming material specifications, and performance verifications, and protocols and reports for studies required to transfer reagent products  into production (e.g. stability, specification-setting, manufacturing process optimization, and related studies). Assist in or lead investigation and resolution of reagent / consumable-related issues, including assessment of impact, root cause identification, and appropriate corrective and preventive action. Ensure consistent compliance with applicable regulations and quality-related best practices in development, validation, use, and documentation of assay development, analytical and functional quality control test methods for reagent lot  qualification, stability studies, and related activities.
