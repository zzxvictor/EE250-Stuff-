We are looking for a true student and connoisseur of design, not bound by the constraints of traditional digital thinking nor the expected design patterns and trends that drive the industry.

You should be skilled in the usual set of design tools, and additional hybrid skillsets are preferred. From sketching, illustrating, motion graphics, 3D software, prototyping and understanding of code & emerging technology platforms. Your ability to translate early stage ideas into quick, hi-fidelity concepts is expected and encouraged. And as a seasoned and fine-tuned weapon of design, you should bring with you a fine eye and appreciation for some structure, intelligent planning and efficiency. You should have an opinion on methodology and practice and weigh into better ways of working without sacrificing the random and often unexpected nature of the design process.  We expect you have curated your work into an impressive portfolio that shows ideas, stories and compelling digital products and platforms.
