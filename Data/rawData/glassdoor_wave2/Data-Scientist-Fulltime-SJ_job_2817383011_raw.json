Its easy to get an autonomous vehicle to work 99% of the time, but its the last 1% thats preventing them from becoming a reality. Thats where we come in. Weve built a breakthrough LiDAR from the chip level up, delivering 50x better resolution and 10x longer range than the most advanced LiDARs available today. Luminar is not just a sensor, but the core of a platform that can enable the industry to have safe autonomous vehicles on the road.We are a diverse team of passionate and driven individuals, making us a powerhouse of innovation, design, engineering, and manufacturing. We are hiring the best and the brightest to accelerate the industry, and bring forward the next transportation revolution.You will develop detection, multi-target tracking algorithms and perception modules required for control of an autonomous vehicle.Responsibilities:Develop multi-target multi-hypothesis tracking algorithms for dynamic objects such as vehicles, pedestrians and distinguishing them from clutter and obstacles.Architect, build, test, and maintain systems for data association and state estimation by processing and fusing raw sensor measurements.Research and develop tracking and fusion algorithms for extended bodies.Skills and Abilities:\u00b7 Academic or research and development experience with theory and design of multi-target multi-sensor algorithms for object tracking and prediction\u00b7 Familiarity with Bayesian or Machine Learning frameworks for detection and tracking\u00b7 Ability to implement algorithms as high-quality real-time software in C++\u00b7 Experience with Multiple Hypothesis Tracking from target-oriented point of view is a plus.\u00b7 PhD preferred.Luminar is an equal opportunity employer.
