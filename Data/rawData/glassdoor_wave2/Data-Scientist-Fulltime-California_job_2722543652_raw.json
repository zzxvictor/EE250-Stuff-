What makes this type of technology so powerful? Context. Focusing on the where allows us to make sense of our businesses, lives, and world, whether that\u2019s through automating portions of workflows to save companies millions of dollars or predicting life-altering events. We are looking for talented machine learning engineers to help build industry-leading predictive geospatial solutions for our customers in 160+ countries. We need a data scientist who is an individually driven, passionate professional to help us create machine learning best practices, not only within Esri but also for the broader GIS community. This game-changing opportunity requires someone with strong hands-on, proven experience with statistical analysis, machine learning, predictive analytics, and software engineering. If you are passionate about changing the world, literally, through machine learning you are in the right place. Where will you leave your mark? Responsibilities:Identify and solve problems. Apply data mining and machine learning techniques, perform statistical analysis, and build high-quality prediction systems that solve our customers' business problems. Explore, interpret, and analyze datasets for patterns of interest.Understand our customers. Work closely with various teams to understand our customers\u2019 needs, eventually crafting and pitching machine learning use cases to them.Deliver results. Model business problems to supervised/unsupervised learning algorithms, map business data to features, perform proper feature engineering, iterate with different models, and conduct hyper parameter optimization to yield highest model performance.Impact change. Help build the data science and machine learning capability inside Esri by developing best practices and patterns for geospatial machine learning, developing reusable technical components for demos and POCs, and identifying and helping establish the needed technology stack and infrastructure. Keep up-to-date with latest technology trends in machine and deep learning and quickly learn about new frameworks/techniques to be used in projects delivery.Requirements4+ years of practical machine learning experienceDeep understanding of machine learning techniques and algorithms, such as k-NN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Forests, etc.Experience with deep learning techniques, mainly CNNs and RNNs (GANs and RL experience is a plus)Experience with spatial data and/or GISExperience in at least one of these toolkits: R, Weka, SciKitl-learn, MATLABFamiliarity with machine learning frameworks/libraries/packages/APIs (e.g., Theano, Spark MLlib, H2O, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)Proven experience in ETL, data processing, transformation, cleaning, and data warehousing techniquesExperience with applied statistics skills, such as distributions, statistical testing, and regressionExperience with widely used probability methods (conditional probability, Bayes rule, likelihood, independence, etc.)Experience with time series analysisExperience with data visualization techniques and tools (e.g., ggPlot2)Strong software engineering background (OOP, data structures, algorithms, computability, and complexity)Excellent conversation and communication skillsBachelor\u2019s in a relevant quantitative field, such as statistics, operations research, or computer science, depending on position level (master's or PhD preferred)Recommended Qualifications:Proven understanding of multivariable calculus and linear algebraExperience dealing with massive data sets, using big data tools (Hadoop HDFS, MapReduce, Accumulo, Presto, MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, R, Mahout, Pig, and Hive, DC/OS)Hands-on experience and expertise with cloud computing services (AWS, Azure, etc.) The CompanyOur passion for improving quality of life through geography is at the heart of everything we do. Esri\u2019s geographic information system (GIS) technology inspires and enables governments, universities, and businesses worldwide to save money, lives, and our environment through a deeper understanding of the changing world around them.  Carefully managed growth and zero debt give Esri stability that is uncommon in today's volatile business world. Privately held, we offer exceptional benefits, competitive salaries, 401(k) and profit-sharing programs, opportunities for personal and professional growth, and much more.
