Kenilworth, N.J., U.S.A. known as Merck in the United States and Canada, is a global health care leader with a diversified portfolio of prescription medicines, vaccines and animal health products. The difference between potential and achievement lies in the spark that fuels innovation and inventiveness; this is the space where Merck has codified its legacy for over a century. Merck\u2019s success is backed by ethical integrity, forward momentum, and an inspiring mission to achieve new milestones in global healthcare.  Merck is on a quest for cures and is committed to being the world\u2019s premier, most research-intensive biopharmaceutical company. Today, we\u2019re doubling down on this goal. Merck Research Laboratories is a true scientific research facility of tomorrow, and will take Merck\u2019s leading discovery capabilities and world-class small molecule and biologics R&D; expertise to create breakthrough science that radically changes the way we approach serious diseases.  Senior scientists in Quantitative Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics (QP2) apply quantitative approaches to develop and implement translational PK/PD strategies, characterize clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of new chemical entities and biologics, and inform dose selection and go/no-go decisions. Senior Scientists work in collaborative teams with more experienced scientists, and are expected to have or develop expertise in one or more areas necessary to performing primary responsibilities including:  Being or supporting the lead representative for QP2 on drug/vaccine development teams  Data management and analysis  Framing critical drug development questions for optimizing model-based development  Developing and executing translational PK/PD approaches, population pharmacokinetic models, exposure-response and stratification biomarker models, quantitative system pharmacology (QSP) and disease progression models, clinical trial design via outcome/enrollment modeling and simulation, comparator modeling, absorption/biopharmaceutical modeling, clinical utility index modeling, and other model-based analyses.  Senior Scientists are expected to develop a comprehensive understanding of global regulatory expectations for small molecules, biologics, and/or vaccines, including support for regulatory documents (INDs, CSRs, CTDs), and agency interactions. The Senior Scientist is a proficient modeler, is able to develop a strong, integrated understanding of the strategic elements of drug discovery and development, and contributes to or leads the combined efforts of QP2 and the wider Department of Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Drug Metabolism (PPDM).  Senior Scientists begin to develop leadership skills in areas such as mentoring, managing a program (while collaborating with QP2 Program Lead), project, or initiative. In addition to the responsibilities outlined above, Senior Scientists demonstrate good communication skills, collaborating within QP2 and with other functional areas, as well as with external vendors and partners, creating an aligned, quantitative framework to impact decisions of drug development teams. QualificationsRequired: Master or equivalent degree with at least four years of experience, where \u201cexperience\u201d means having a record of increasing responsibility and independence in a similar role in pharmaceutical drug development or academia.  Ph.D. or equivalent degree - OR- a PharmD or equivalent degree with at least two years of experience or an educational background in biopharmaceutics, pharmaceutical sciences, pharmacometrics, mathematics, statistics/ biostatistics, computational biology/chemistry, chemical/biomedical engineering, or a related field.  Proficiency in R, Matlab, SAS, or other similar programing language  Preferred:  Experience in performing population PK / PKPD and non-compartmental analyses  Experience with standard pharmacometric software (e.g. NONMEM, Monolix, Phoenix, etc.)  Skills in experimental design, mathematical problem solving, critical data analysis/interpretation, and statistics  Scientific understanding of biopharmaceutical and ADME properties  Proficiency in written and verbal communication, interdisciplinary collaboration, and problem scoping and planning"}
