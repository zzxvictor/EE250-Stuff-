Founded in 1913 and headquartered in Duarte, California, City of Hope is a remarkable non-profit institution, where compassion and advanced care go hand-in-hand with excellence in clinical and scientific research. City of Hope is a National Cancer Institute designated Comprehensive Cancer Center and a founding member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of the nations 20 leading cancer centers that develops and institutes standards of care for cancer treatment. Requisition 13704Postdoctoral Scientist, Mschen LaboratoryDepartment of Systems Biology, Beckman Research InstitutePosition Summary and Key Responsibilities: Our group is interested in comparative analyses of normal lymphocyte development and malignant transformation towards leukemia. We cover research areas with relevance to both Immunology, Hematology and Cancer Biology. Our research involves experiments with primary human leukemia cells, leukemia and stem cell transplantation models, mouse genetics, classical molecular and cell biology, a strong emphasis on signal transduction and large-scale data analysis and computational biology. Qualifications: PhD in cell or molecular biology, genuine enthusiasm for science, willingness to think beyond established concepts and to try and learn new experimental and analysis tools. The lab takes a team science approach, so being a nice person and enjoyable to work with is important as well. Your application should include in one singlePDF: CV, brief motivation statement, coordinates of three scientific mentors (references) Methods/Techniques: Flow cytometry, mass spectrometry/quantitative phospho-profiling, CyTOF, mouse genetics, bone marrow transplantation assays, retroviral gene delivery, whole exome sequencing andRNA-seq-analysis of clonal evolution of leukemia, pre-clinical drug testing in xenotransplantation models.
