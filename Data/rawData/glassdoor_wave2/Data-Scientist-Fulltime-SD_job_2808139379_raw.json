Wearable devices and sensors installed throughout homes measure daily activities of individuals. A variety of physical parameters are continually collected, aggregated, processed, and monitored. This information is augmented with data from business operations as well as trained staff in direct contact with customers. Machine learning and other algorithms are used to interpret data into meaningful trends and predictions. The system is implemented by a robust, horizontally-scalable software architecture. Our technical staff includes software engineers, product designers, infrastructure professionals, data scientists, and business intelligence analysts. We work closely with product managers and other groups to understand and formulate requirements with freedom to recommend and explore solutions. We analyze data, develop and implement algorithms, and monitor results to ensure that our products function reliably to serve our customers. ABOUT THE JOB You will be working on socially-fulfilling products deeply involved in the areas of data analytics, cloud-based big data, and Internet of Things (IoT). You will be a major stakeholder in these products by analyzing data, developing predictive models, implementing algorithms in code, validating and testing performance, and presenting results. This position would be a good fit for machine learning engineers and data scientists who enjoy both developing algorithms and making them work robustly in code, or a software engineer with a thorough understanding of algorithms that learn from data. You must be capable of complex problem solving, self-motivated, and willing to frequently interact with people possessing different skill sets across business areas.
