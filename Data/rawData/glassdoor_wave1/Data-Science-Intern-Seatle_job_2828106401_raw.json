These bandwidth intensive technologies of the future cannot take place utilizing current wireless and broadband network infrastructure. Pivotal Commware has developed a revolutionary technology called HBF or Holographic Beam Forming, a breakthrough in electromagnetic physics. This disruptive software defined antenna technology is revolutionizing wireless and broadband networks by helping network operators solve their biggest wireless access challenges capacity and spectral efficiency. Our patented antenna technology helps wireless service providers squeeze every ounce of performance from their networks at the lowest cost, size, weight and power consumption available. While Pivotal has completely redefined the physics and economics of providing broadband wireless access for consumer, business and military applications, we still need to tailor our technology for a multitude of compelling use cases. Looking ahead, our team will also be developing artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions to complement and enhance our fundamental technology. If you are passionate about what you do and want to apply yourself to this fascinating endeavor, then wed like to hear from you.Pivotal is seeking a Data Scientist to drive fast-paced research and development projects while working closely with a small group of scientists, engineers and business leaders in a start-up environment. The candidate will be responsible for applying both analytic, numerical, ML and AI methods to improve antenna performance, optimize KPIs and enhance communication system efficiency.
