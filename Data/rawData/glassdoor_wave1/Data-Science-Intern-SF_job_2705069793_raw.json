Not that long ago we were just an app to request premium black cars in a few metropolitan areas. Now we\u2019re a part of the logistical fabric of more than 600 cities around the world. Whether it\u2019s a ride, a sandwich, or a package, we use technology to give people what they want, when they want it.  For the people who drive with Uber, our app represents a flexible new way to earn money. For cities, we help strengthen local economies, improve access to transportation, and make streets safer.  And that\u2019s just what we\u2019re doing today. We\u2019re thinking about the future, too. With teams working on autonomous trucking and self-driving cars, we\u2019re in for the long haul. We\u2019re reimagining how people and things move from one place to the next.  The mission of the Labs team is to leverage applied behavioral science to power products and cities.
