Flexible work schedule at our DTLA office in Little Tokyo.This is not a remote position.Must be eligible to work in the USA - no sponsorships.About The/Studio We are building a company that could be equivalent in scale and relevance to Amazon. Sounds like an exaggeration \u2014 but let us explain:  Amazon (and e-commerce in general) have completely disrupted the \"last mile\" \u2014 from ordering products easily to getting those products delivered to your door. But the \"first mile\" in the supply chain, where the product is actually produced, hasnt changed in over a hundred years. In spite of that, its value of this market is immense and only keeps growing. Fashion / apparel manufacturing alone is a $1.2 trillion industry.  We've built an on-demand manufacturing platform (manufacturing-as-a-service) that meets the needs of the 21st century economy. We bootstrapped our way to a $15M run rate and just closed a $10M Series A with a top-tier Silicon Valley VC. We believe we can create enormous value and literally change the world by making fast-turn, low volume manufacturing accessible to everyone.  The/Studio is hiring game-changing marketing, technology and supply chain experts for our Los Angeles and San Francisco offices."}
