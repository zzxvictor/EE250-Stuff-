The organization was formed in 2002 to fully integrate the activities underlying faculty support and development. HBS is unique among top business schools, perhaps in higher education more broadly, in having a unit like the DRFD \u2013 one that funds faculty research internally, provides centralized research services, and combines nearly all faculty-related administration and services under one umbrella. From the time a prospective faculty member is identified as a recruiting candidate, and whether a faculty member spends six months or their entire career at HBS, the DRFD team\u2019s focus is to support the success of each individual and contribute to an environment where they can thrive and do their best work in service of the School\u2019s mission.  RCS is a centralized service within the DRFD that supports faculty for all their research computing needs. These services include managing access to and support for the research computing infrastructure and research computing software as well as a full range of research computing services provided directly to faculty in conducting their research including data collection, acquisition, processing, and manipulation; statistical programming and methodological consulting; and data analysis, visualization and presentation of data.

Members of RCS team provide consultation services to faculty and other researchers and work on specific research projects for faculty members.  The ideal candidate has experience with multiple steps in the data life cycle, including data acquisition, data processing, data management, analysis, and visualization, preferably in a research environment; and brings technical programming expertise using research software packages.
