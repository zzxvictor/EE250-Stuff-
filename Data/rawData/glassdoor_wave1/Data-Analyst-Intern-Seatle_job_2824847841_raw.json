The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) is an independent research center at the University of Washington focused on expanding the quantitative evidence base for health. IHME aims to provide the best possible quantitative evidence base to policymakers, donors, and researchers in order to make decisions that lead to better health. Often that means providing as complete a picture as possible of health in a particular country, drawing upon a wide array of secondary data sources and helping prepare and execute primary data collection processes and systems. IHME has an outstanding opportunity for a Data Analyst on the Global Fund Prospective Country Evaluation (PCE). The PCE provides an opportunity to examine critical processes, outputs, outcomes, and ultimately the impact of Global Fund investments through a comprehensive country-level lens using a diverse array of data and methodologies. The IHME/PATH Global Evaluation Partnership (GEP) is working with Country Evaluation Partners (CEPs) in three countries: Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Guatemala and Uganda for this study. The data analyst will contribute to the data collation, data management, and implementation of analytics to perform resource tracking studies, output/outcome measurement, and impact evaluation of Global Fund Grants in DRC, Guatemala, and Uganda.  The Data Analyst will be integral to contributing to data management, data cleaning, and the creation of graphics and tables for presentations and reports.
