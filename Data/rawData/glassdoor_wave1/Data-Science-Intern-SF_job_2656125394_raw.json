Castlight wants to help users navigate the world of healthcare and sickcare. That is to say, we want to motivate healthy habits - and reward people - in $$ for living healthfully. And we want to help users when they are sick - finding the right medical provider, service or company program that is best for them. For example, I am now earning reward points (that convert to cash) for tracking my daily workout, my sleep, and what I eat. And, on the other side of the equation, if you need an wrist X-ray for that carpal tunnel from either too much coding, or more likely too much texting \u2013 and then choose the best doctor for you.
