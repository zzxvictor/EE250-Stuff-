MSR AI is comprised of researchers, engineers, and postdocs who take a broad perspective on the next-generation of intelligent systems. We seek applicants from all areas of deep learning, reinforcement learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and related fields with a passion and demonstrated ability for research. Interns will work closely with research mentors on research projects with the goal of publishing results in top venues.  During a 12-week internship, students are paired with mentors and expected to collaborate with other interns and researchers, present findings, and contribute to the vibrant life of the community. Internships are offered year-round, although they typically begin in the summer. All internships are paid. We will help with visa applications where needed.  Examples of current projects and directions in deep learning include: Multi-modal intelligence, fusing vision and language capabilitiesReinforcement learning, including applications to dialog systems, games, and operational control problemsNatural language processing with applications to language understand and language generationNeuro-symbolic systems and reasoningNeural program synthesisFoundations of deep learning, algorithms and machine teachingAdditional publications are available on the MSR AI website.
