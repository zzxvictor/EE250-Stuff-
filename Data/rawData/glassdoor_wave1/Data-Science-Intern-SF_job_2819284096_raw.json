Advertisers can then use these attributes to specify the type of person their advertisement should target. What you will do: The best way to understand a person's interests is by understanding how they spend their time online. If we can understand the topics, concepts, and entities related to and referenced in the online content that people engage with on and off of Twitter, then we can understand a person's interests in great detail. You will help us build machine learned models, as well as the platform that leverages these models to automatically classify tweets, websites, mobile applications, and real world points of interest. You will build cutting-edge deep learning models for understanding the semantics of text, images, and videos. Finally, you will help us build a state-of-the-art entity resolution platform that can identify references to people, places, and things found in text, images, and videos, and then automatically link these references to entity records in our knowledge-base.
