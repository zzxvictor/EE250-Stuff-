Bell Labs defines Nokia\u2019s technological and architectural vision for the ICT industry, identifies the key challenges in this vision and invents solutions that are an order of magnitude (10X) better than existing solutions. It advises the industry on the economics of the vision\u200b and underlying technologies, and how best to transform to most efficiently achieve the goals. Driving thought leadership among customers and the industry strengthens Nokia\u2019s role as a market leader and creator. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b  Discovering the possibilities that shape the human experience are at the heart of everything we do. Our interns will have the opportunity to learn from and work with world experts, and the best and brightest minds, who solve the most formidable networking and communications challenges confronting our world through disruptive innovation and research.  Our researchers are continually massively scaling the capabilities of networks from the data center to the end device, to change the way we live and work, by inventing breakthrough technologies to make networks and systems faster, smarter and greener.As well as providing hands-on educational and collaborative experiences for a pool of talented and highly motivated students, our internship program will expand your field of study by exposing you to an unparalleled diversity of people, expertise and perspectives. In classic Bell Labs style, you will leave changed forever by an experience that will redefine your future.Application Areas:Access: Project topics include new breakthrough technologies for the communications systems that directly connect with end users, wireless in 5G radios, transceiver design, massive MIMO, and communications theory, new disruptions in faster fiber and fiber-like speeds over copper to enable seemingly infinite capacity and edge clouds for low latency computing.
