We use law, science, and the support of more than three million members and activists to protect the planet\u2019s wildlife and wild places and to ensure a safe and healthy environment for all living things. Founded in 1970, NRDC staff helped write some of America\u2019s bedrock environmental laws. Today, our staff of more than 600 lawyers, scientists, economists, policy and communications experts, and others, works to protect and create environmental progress from offices in New York; Washington, DC; Chicago; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Bozeman, Montana; and Beijing.  Our Litigation team works on cases spanning a broad range of environmental issues, such as combating climate change, protecting public health, promoting environmental justice, curbing air and water pollution, preserving wildlife and wild places, and reducing overfishing. In recent years, members of the Litigation team in San Francisco have litigated to protect marine mammals from the U.S. Navy\u2019s harmful sonar and explosives training, safeguard the health of Californians by limiting the presence of dangerous chemicals in food and water, and defend a state program which will contribute over one billion dollars to clean energy research.  NRDC is seeking current college students with strong grades, excellent writing and research skills, and the intelligence, confidence, and maturity to assume serious responsibility. Research Interns work with the Litigation team\u2019s San Francisco-based attorneys and program assistants on factual research and analysis to support developing and active cases. They also support the team by occasionally performing legal administrative work. Interns are invited to participate in litigation planning and strategy meetings.  We ask that you seek academic credit for the internship if you are eligible. We can help with applications or any other materials needed to secure the credit (e.g. preparation of workplans and evaluations, meetings with academic advisors, etc.). If you are not eligible for academic credit for the internship, we offer a $15.00/hour stipend.
