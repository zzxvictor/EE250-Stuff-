Our tech moves beyond screens and pixels, creating a new reality aimed at bringing us closer together-whether that is scientists meeting on the surface of a virtual Mars or some yet undreamt-of possibility. To get there, we are incorporating diverse groundbreaking technologies, from the revolutionary Holographic Processing Unit to computer vision, machine learning, human-computer interaction, and more.  We are a growing team of talented engineers and artists putting technology on a human path across all Windows devices, including Microsoft HoloLens, the Internet of Things, phones, tablets, desktops, and Xbox. We believe there has to be a better way. If you do too, we need you!  Building products customers love is our obsession! Our team works on data analysis and machine learning problems, enabling Analog to make the best possible decisions about its business, experiences and technology. We partner with business owners and PMs to translate their questions/goals into a data science project, determine sources of data, conduct the analysis that will reveal actionable insights, and develop/operationalize models. We fully embrace Microsofts growth mindset, our team does our own explorations and encourages hackathons, enabling us not only to innovate but to also bring insights proactively to our customers.Responsibilities"}
