What you\u2019ll get: You\u2019ll learn more about \u201creal-world\u201d finance in your first few months than any class ever taught you-- thanks in part to our unique mentor program. You\u2019ll be encouraged to ask questions, improve processes, and propose novel solutions to problems.

That\u2019s how our top executives got there, and we think you can do it too. In fact, we hope you\u2019ll advance to your next role within 1 to 3 years (a typical outcome for successful employees). Add more value, get more value back. What we\u2019d like: An unrelenting work ethic, a track record of success, stellar communication abilities, and a drive to succeed. And if you are a high-achiever with a background in something other than finance, don\u2019t worry-- you won\u2019t be alone at Fisher Investments, where some of our top employees studied subjects that span the humanities and the sciences. The bottom line: If this job posting seems different from those of our competitors, it\u2019s because we really are different: it\u2019s not just a slogan or a mantra. We are out to change an industry by building a better mousetrap. No tricks, no games, just top-tier money management and excellent service to our clients. To do that, we need to hire the best of the best. So, what are you waiting for?  We believe in providing the training needed to be successful in our entry-level roles. Accordingly, none of our entry-level jobs require the highly specialized knowledge needed for us to sponsor an H-1B visa and we therefore do not provide sponsorship for entry-level positions.
