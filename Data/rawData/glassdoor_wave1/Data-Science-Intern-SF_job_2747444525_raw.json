It\u2019s no secret that recruiting is broken. The current process leaves all engaged parties \u2013 candidates, clients, and recruiters alike \u2013 exhausted; this is all too telling of the status quo\u2019s fundamental flaws. Candidates struggle to find the best jobs for their skillsets; clients can\u2019t fill their open roles with the best people; a recruiter\u2019s ability dictates the pace of information flow, for better or worse.
