You\u2019ll leverage your pipeline and your cold calling skills to uncover, qualify and close new opportunities with new clients, and this process will include understanding the business problems of your prospects and giving smart, polished demos of our solutions. By ruthlessly qualifying opportunities and creating new ones through need/benefit discussions with prospects, you\u2019ll be able to clearly articulate buying rationale and close a ton of business. You\u2019ll also be a Salesforce.com power user, providing transparency into your pipeline. What it isn\u2019t: This role isn\u2019t retail consumer sales, so your work experience must include B2B sales (preferably in the institutional investment technology space). It also isn\u2019t mired in paper; if your technology skills (think PowerPoint, advanced Excel, WebEx, etc.) aren\u2019t truly stellar, you\u2019ll have a hard time keeping up. If speaking in front of strangers makes your neck splotchy and your palms sweaty, this role isn\u2019t a fit for you. We need you to have a natural talent for presenting details with professional flair, including a fantastic speaking voice and assertive, confident demeanor (but no finger guns here). This role doesn\u2019t function in a vacuum; if you\u2019re uncomfortable with high levels of accountability via regular weekly conversations with leadership about your results and what\u2019s in the queue, you might find this responsibility uncomfortable.ABOUT YOUWho you are: You\u2019re an eager student of the investment management world who devours learning. You find it unbelievable that most of society can\u2019t explain the difference between a stock and a bond. Maybe you\u2019ve worked for 2-3 years at an investment management firm, an institutional consulting shop or with wealth management clients. You\u2019re passionate about the industry but have figured out that you don\u2019t see yourself as a career analyst. At the same time, you don\u2019t want to be a financial advisor who hits up your friends and family for their retirement accounts. You hate to do things the old fashioned way, and always ask yourself: how will this work be done in ten years? What role will technology play?  You\u2019re looking for a job where you can be creative and work independently, but enjoy the structure and accountability that being part of the team provides. You love to work with a broad group of team members involved in marketing, product innovation, client service, lead generation and legal. You also respect the details involved after the sale, including the sometimes tedious contract process and the Salesforce.com CRM data (but you realize how valuable this tool can be). Ultimately, you are passionately driven to achieve and be recognized for that achievement.  Your friends/colleagues would describe you as a great teacher\u2014always able to communicate complicated concepts in clear terms with patience. You\u2019re known for your dedicated work ethic\u2014 if you run out of things to do at work you find yourself doing other people\u2019s jobs\u2026better than they were doing them initially (but never gloating or belittling, because you\u2019re better than that). You\u2019re an initiator\u2014you planned last week\u2019s social outing with your friends/family, and you\u2019ll probably plan the next one, too. You\u2019re winsome and outgoing\u2014 even your dental hygienist loves you and remembers your last conversation from six months ago. You\u2019re also protective of your reputation and prefer to be known by your integrity instead of your cunning.ABOUT USWho we are:We are eVestment, and we make smart money smarter.
