CTC partners with colleges and universities to develop scientifically proven approaches that place the student experience at the center of institutional programs and practices. Our work helps institutions better understand how their students experience moments of transition or difficulty, and how psychologically-informed practices can convey to all students they are valued, respected, and can excel. CTC\u2019s work has helped support greater engagement, retention, and completion for students at diverse colleges and universities across the United States, particularly for traditionally marginalized groups such as students of color, first-generation students, and low-income students.

We are seeking a Senior Data Analyst to lead data processing and analysis for multiple ongoing large-scale randomized controlled experiments. The Analyst will oversee all stages of the data pipeline, from standardizing disparate raw data sources (e.g., survey data, institution provided data, etc.) containing millions of records to conducting complex analyses for both scientific and practitioner audiences. This individual will be an essential project member who will be expected to learn and work independently, yet collaborate effectively with team members and project partners. Previous experience processing data and conducting analyses for empirical research projects, particularly projects with a focus on social psychology or education, in an academic environment is a plus. The work will take place in a dynamic environment where specifications often change rapidly in response to demands from both researchers and practitioners, so the analyst must be able to be flexible in their approach and implementations.  Additional details about the responsibilities:  1. Processing and managing data Implement processes to collect, process, and manage raw data from diverse sources (e.g., complex surveys, institutional records from multiple sources and timepoints), producing clean and user-friendly datasets for both internal analysis needs and sharing with affiliates and collaborators.Create clear, standard data requests in collaboration with researchers and fellow CTC staff to share with school partners based on project research questions; work closely with fellow CTC staff and data teams at partner institutions to validate accuracy and usability of data shared, including training CTC staff to understand data request specifications and to perform relevant checks.Advise on and implement data storage and security practices. 2. Analyzing data Collaborate with researchers and fellow CTC staff to determine analytic approach for projects in light of key research questions, modifying approach as necessary given nuances of data that are available (e.g., limitations in institution-provided data, etc.), and to pre-register analysis plans when appropriate.Use both qualitative and quantitative techniques to lead data analysis for all stages of CTC\u2019s research projects, including both earlier stage research and development such as surveys, focus groups, and smaller scale experiments, and later stage large-scale field tests such as randomized controlled trials. Analytic techniques may include but are not limited to: multilevel models, OLS models, structural equation models, clustering techniques, and specification curves/permutation tests.Serve as a resource for non-routine analysis inquiries. 3. Reporting results Work under consultative or self-initiated direction to report analysis findings for researchers, school partners, and external audiences.Develop processes and write/modify reproducible scripts to automate custom report generation.Write concise, focused prose interpretation of analysis findings for diverse internal and external audiences, varying the language used and level of detail depending on audience background and interests.Distribute and disseminate reports to applicable agencies, researchers, management and other internal end-users. CTC is an early-stage organization, and we are excited to build out our data processes and team over the coming years. This role includes the opportunity to drive decision-making around our data policies and infrastructure in addition to conducting data processing and analyses for discrete large-scale projects.
