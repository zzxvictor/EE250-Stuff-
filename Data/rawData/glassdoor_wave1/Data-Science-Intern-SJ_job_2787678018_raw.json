I am an adjunct psychology professor at San Jose State University where I have formed my own autism research lab . My passion and inspiration to help children and families affected by autism came after both of my sons were diagnosed with autism. Living with autism with my two children over the years made me learn and understand what an autism family really needs. Over the years, I sought out almost all possible treatments for my kids to notice the lack of effective treatments and services not only for the children who are affected by autism but also for their families. I recently establish a center and home-based therapy center at Mountain View and looking for a dedicated BCBA.
