The Senior Product Advisor will be assigned to a sales team within a geographic area to train, aid and assist in helping the Relationship Manager and Territory Manager to sell our product either on their own or by way of referral so that the Senior Product Advisor (SPA) can sell it to the end user directly. The compensation is highly leveraged with the opportunity for creating passive income. Role Your role as a Senior Product Advisor is to close sales of our payroll solutions with merchants throughout the area. As a Senior Product Advisor with Heartland, you will work closely with your local Division or Payroll Territory Manager to set appointments with business owners over the phone, face-to-face, through your network, and via referral partnerships that you build. You will then run scheduled appointments, uncover needs, and present Heartland solutions to close sales in our target vertical markets (restaurants, retail, medical, lodging, auto repair, salons, etc.). A Senior Product Advisor reports to a Division Manager and receives coaching from a Payroll Territory Manager.  During the training/ramp-up period, your local manager will accompany you on your initial appointments to train you on our short-cycle sales process using Atlas, our groundbreaking tablet-based CRM platform for lead generation, sales presentations, on the spot client financial analysis, and paperless contract processing.
