Do you like being on the go and meeting new people? We invite you to join our talented team of branch operations and service leaders while filling in at locations throughout the Peninsula Bay Area.  What is a Floating Branch Manager (BM)? We\u2019re glad you asked! Our floating BMs are full-time managers (receiving our generous and full benefits package) who have the opportunity to be introduced to the many locations and communities Provident serves. They travel to branches to pitch in and lead where and when needed. They may be called upon to handle cash, interact with members (we have members, not customers because we are a credit union, not a bank!), manage operations or coach and share their sales and service knowledge with staff. It could all be in a day\u2019s work. This position is the first step in your management career with Provident. It is also an ideal way to take us for a test drive and determine a branch fit for you. If you welcome the opportunity to be in a different place every few days, weeks or months (at least during your initial time period with us), Provident could be the perfect fit for you as you progress in your banking career!  This float position will primarily provide coverage for the Peninsula (San Francisco to Los Gatos) branches, but may cover other branches on occasion.  We have 18 Bay Area branches from San Francisco (two locations) to San Jose (two locations) and points in between on the Peninsula (Daly City, Millbrae, San Mateo, Belmont, Redwood Shores, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, Los Gatos) and in the East Bay (Hayward, Oakland, San Ramon, Dublin, Alameda and Walnut Creek). Of course we will do our best to match our needs with where you reside whenever we can. We\u2019ll talk to you more about how it would work when we meet!
