We work with big, high profile clients, shaping and delivering complex and transformational change. Our partners and consultants help these organisations tackle their most critical challenges, often by working as an integral part of their leadership teams. Our focus is always on making change happen, making it successful and making it last.Our people focus on building trusting, long term client relationships and only selling work that clients need and want. We truly believe this is key to our success, and our repeat/referral business supports this. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t afford to compromise on the quality of people we hire. At Berkeley we develop talented consultants rather than hire in at the most senior levels, so it is important to us that we hire people at the right point in their career. We look for high achievers with 7 \u2013 12 years consulting experience working in high quality, often large consulting firms. Joiners will have a proven project leadership track record, and the ability to build strong relationships with blue-chip clients.  But meeting our requirements is only part of the story. Life at The Berkeley Partnership is very different from larger firms. With freedom, trust and autonomy comes a high level of accountability. This is by no means a soft option. There\u2019s a strong focus on personal and professional development, with a partner to consultant ratio of 1:4. We don\u2019t do hierarchy. There are just two levels, Partner and Consultant and if the offer of Partnership comes, you\u2019ll know it means something.  Being owner-managed, we can shape the kind of firm we want to work in. We offer our consultants the chance to develop themselves professionally and to work towards success for our clients and for the firm. Our trusting and open culture makes Berkeley both a professional and sociable place to work, with high levels of autonomy and little bureaucracy. You\u2019ll need to be adaptable and open minded about different ways of working and projects/industry sectors that are outside of your comfort zone. Sometimes you\u2019ll be leading, sometimes supporting. Sometimes you\u2019ll be on your own, although there\u2019s always support from your colleagues when you need it. The pressure can be every bit as high as you\u2019ve experienced before but most of our people find it easier to balance their work and personal interests in a smaller, more flexible firm.  You\u2019ll find our recruitment process thorough and demanding but friendly too. We know it\u2019s a big time commitment, so we urge you to read our website carefully before taking the next step. If you are the right person for us and are ready for a significant career move, it\u2019s time well spent.
