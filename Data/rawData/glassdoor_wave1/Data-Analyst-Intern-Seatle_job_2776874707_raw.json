Laboratory expertise spans acoustic and remote sensing, ocean physics and engineering, medical and industrial ultrasound, polar science and logistics, environmental and information systems, and electronic and photonic systems. APL has an outstanding opportunity for a part time (50% FTE) Data Analyst.  This position is located in the Polar Science Center (PSC). The Polar Science Center conducts basic and applied research on the oceanography, climatology, meteorology, biology and ecology of the ice-covered regions on Earth and elsewhere in our solar system. The scope of PSC research and fieldwork includes the Arctic and the Antarctic, as well as sea-ice, glaciers and continental ice sheets.  Under the direction and supervision of the principal scientist Dr. Kristin Laidre, this position will provide research support and assistance for Laidre\u2019s Arctic marine mammal ecology program. This position requires work on multiple research projects, and prioritizing work with simultaneous and competing timelines. This position requires interaction with Laidre, other scientists and collaborators on research projects, graduate students, and any other groups integral to the successful completion of the research projects. This position requires a self-motivated, independent and enthusiastic candidate with GIS experience and an interest in biological and/or earth science questions.
