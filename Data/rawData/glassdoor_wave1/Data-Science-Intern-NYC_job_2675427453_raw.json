Our growing database of 400,000 images of art, architecture, and design by 50,000 artists spans historical, modern, and contemporary works, and includes the largest online database of contemporary art. Artsy is used by art lovers, museum-goers, patrons, collectors, students, and educators to discover, learn about, and collect art.WHY ARTSYAt Artsy there are no specific work hours or policies, no pointless bureaucracy.

You will enjoy both responsibility and autonomy in your work.WORKING AT ARTSYIn addition to our vision of a world where art is as popular as music, Artsy has five core values that will inform your experience at Artsy. Art x Science: We believe in uniting empathy with logic, emotion with data, and intuition with research in everything we do. Whether in business strategy or design, culture or code, we seek the magic that happens when the often separate worlds of art and science come together. People are Paramount: We spend extraordinary energy finding the best person for a job\u2014and once found, we give them the trust and autonomy to be CEO of their role. We avoid pointless bureaucracy and prefer to empower people with information rather than limit them with process. Quality Worthy of Art: We aim to create an experience worthy of all the world\u2019s art and so hold ourselves to the highest standards in all our work. We believe that the best long term quality comes from rapid shipping, iterating, and learning as we go. Positive Energy: We know positivity and optimism benefit our work, and we harness positive energy as a vehicle towards greater awareness, growth, and collaboration. We believe in cultivating a positive relationship to art as opposed to one based on exclusivity or scarcity. Openness: We believe in being open with each other and the world\u2014whether in open-sourcing our code, sharing feedback, or building a diverse and inclusive work culture. We believe in bringing our full selves to work and manifesting an open world where everyone has access to art. Artsy is an equal opportunity employer.
